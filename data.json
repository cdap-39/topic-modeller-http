        "content": "Colombo (News1st) – Over the past few days, News1st has been reporting on a Rs 10bn loan granted by People’s Bank to MTD Walkers PLC. The loan is special not only because it is the largest loan issued by the bank in its history but also because Jehan Amaratunge who sits on the People’s bank board of Directors also holds the position of Executive Deputy Chairman of MTD Walkers PLC.\nSenior Banker Rusiripala Tennakoon joining News1st for a special interview noted that Jehan Amaratunge has been serving as a member of the People’s bank, board of directors since 2010. He noted that it is very rare to see an individual continuing to serve for a long period of time especially in a backdrop where there was a change in Government.\nTennakoon revealed that any related party transactions undertaken by a banking institution needs to be referred to an audit committee of the same bank. The senior banker also revealed that Amaratunge serves as the Chairman of the Audit Committee of People’s bank and that this itself is unethical.\nA MINISTERIAL EXPLANATION\nThe matter relating to the Rs 10bn loan was raised during a media briefing in Colombo today. Journalists questioned whether Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera is aware of such a loan being granted.\nHowever, it was State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickremeratne who jumped at the opportunity to respond to the query. The State Minister noted that matters relating to loans are controlled by the management of the relevant bank and that ministers do not intervene in any shape or form in the decision-making process. He requested the journalists to pose this question to the bank itself.\nMinister Mangala Samaraweera explained that the banking sector does not fall under the purview of the Ministry of Finance. He noted that the subject minister in charge of banks is currently Lakshman Kiriella.\nJournalists then questioned the minister on whether obtaining such a loan was ethical? State Minister Wickremeratne responded by stating that there was a conflict of interest in this particular instance.\nA CONFLICT OF INTEREST\nMano Thittawella who is an adviser to the Ministry of Finance also arrived at the media briefing and journalists questioned him regarding the issue surrounding ETI Finance. It was Min. Mangala Samaraweera who responded to the journalists by stating that Thittawella was present at the location in his capacity as an advisor and requested the journalists to question him on ETI after the event. Min. Samaraweera was confident enough to say that his advisor would respond to the media after the event, unfortunately, Tittawella refused to comment on the record following the event.\nMinister Mangala Samaraweera and State Minister Eran Wickremeratne spoke about conflict of interest at the media briefing.\nIsn’t it a conflict of interest when the person who was the chairman and managing director of the EAP group to which ETI Finance belongs is now functioning as an advisor to the Ministry of Finance. Mano Thittawella also functions as a board member at Sri Lankan Airlines as well as the Secretary General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms. During former governments, Mano Tittawella has held several key positions.\nMinister Malik Samarawickreme held an inspection tour of the construction of a Tyre factory in Horana recently along with Nandana Lokuvithana who is allegedly involved in financial misappropriation during the previous government. Lokuvithana is the current owner of Speville Ceylon of which Minister Malik Samarawickreme was functioning as a director in the past.\nJehan Amaratunga who has obtained a loan of Rs. 10bn from the People’s Bank for his company has taken his post as director of the People’s Bank during the last government in the year 2010. All these individuals are working well to make sure that their objectives are reached.\nOne could very well say that there seems to be no difference between the people that were in power before and the people in power today.\nIn this myriad of depressing reports, there is a bright light, although it does come from the unlikeliest of persons.\nPROMISE OF AN INVESTIGATION\nMinister of Public Enterprise Lakshman Kiriella speaking to News1st today noted that he has called for an immediate investigation into the Rs. 10bn loan granted by People’s bank.\nWhile stating that he got to know of this issue through the media the Minister noted that he had instructed his Ministry Secretary and the Chairman of the People’s bank to conduct an immediate inquiry and report back to him.\nWe must praise this good measure taken by the Minister, which comes after a long time. Time will tell if this is just another empty promise made by another politician.",

        "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – Myanmar has scaled back plans for a Chinese-backed port on its western coast, sharply reducing the cost of the project after concerns it could leave the Southeast Asian nation heavily indebted. A top government official and an advisor told Reuters the initial 7.3 billion US Dollar price tag on the port, set off alarm bells due to reports of troubled Chinese-backed projects in Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\nThe Kyauk Pyu deepwater port is being constructed on the western tip of Myanmar’s conflict-torn Rakhine state. Deputy Finance Minister Set Aung, who was appointed to lead project negotiations in May, told Reuters the “project size has been tremendously scaled down”.\nThe Deputy Minister said the revised cost would be “around 1.3 billion Dollars, something that’s much more plausible for Myanmar’s use”. China’s state-run CITIC Group, the main developer of the project, said negotiations were ongoing and that the 1.3 billion Dollars was to be spent on the “initial phase” of the port, adding the project was divided into four phases.\nThe Kyauk Pyu port is a key part of China’s ambitious Belt and Road initiative, aimed at expanding trade links across the world. Kyauk Pyu is an entry point for a 770-kilometre pipeline delivering oil and natural gas to China’s Yunnan province.\nThat gives China an alternative route for energy imports from the Middle East that avoids the strategic chokepoint of the Malacca Strait. Construction on the port, and an accompanying special economic zone, which together were supposed to cost up to US$10 billion, was expected to start in 2018.\nBut Myanmar officials said the experience of Sri Lanka, where this year the government signed over to China the lease on a strategic port to pay off Chinese-backed loans used to finance it, had raised concerns the country could be walking into a debt trap.\nThe deputy finance minister of Myanmar said his country would give no sovereign guarantees for any loans financing the project.",

He stated that it was an amendment proposal for a mixed development project on a state-owned land, located down Baladaksha Mawatha between the Beira Lake and the Shangri La Hotel, which was to be implemented by Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited.\nMP Kanchana Wijesekara states that this proposal was among the land acts presented last week. According to him, this aim of this act was to provide the ownership of this land to the Singaporean company Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited. MP Kanchana goes on to state that, the state valuation for this land is Rs 12.5 mn per perch. The Parliamentarian notes that if the Government calls for tenders to lease out this land, they would be able to get a better price.\nCommenting on the same matter; Leader of the National Unity Alliance Party, Azath Salley states that Perennial Real Estate Holdings Limited which is a Singaporean owned company, is requesting for another piece of land behind Shangri-La. He further explained that no one knows who the owner of this company is, except for Mano Thiththawella and Malik Samarawickrama.\nHe said that his main concern was with regards to whose money is being invested in these projects? Salley questioned whether the money coming into the country was black money which was pumped out of the country.\nAzath Salley further explained that individuals come into Sri Lanka not only as investors, but also occupies positions in Malik Samarawickrama’s Private Companies.\nElaborating further MP Azath Salley stated that the Singapore-Sri Lanka Trade Agreement is being criticized by everyone. He notes that the Trade Agreement bill was supposed to be sent back to the cabinet for further ratification but it was not. Azath Salley further states that when Min Malik was questioned regarding this matter, he has not clarified the matter.

        "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – Since the current administration was elected to power there have been a plethora of taxes imposed on the general public. The cost of living is on the rise and it seems that this unbearable cost of living is beginning to take a toll on our elected public representatives as well.\nIt could be because of this very reason that they are planning on giving themselves a pay rise, as a pat on the back for the hard work that they have put in to improve the state of the country over the past 3 years. Several newspapers reported on Thursday (Aug. 2nd) quoting parliamentary sources that our public representatives stand to benefit from a whopping 215% pay increase.\nHow will the Government pass such a proposal through Parliament? By simply ensuring that this pay increase benefits everyone across the board. Yes! the proposal seeks to increase the salaries of Ministers, Deputy Ministers, State Ministers and Parliamentarians, thus ensuring bipartisan support in Parliament which is rarely seen in any matter of national concern.\nThe media reports indicate that the proposal to increase the salaries came up for discussion during the party leaders meeting held on the 17th of July. The reports add that the salary increment would be retrospectively applied from January this year and that it would be paid this month with the arrears.\nCRUNCHING THE NUMBERS\nThe current salary of a member of Parliament is Rs.54,285. If this proposed salary increment does come into play MPs will see their monthly salary rise to Rs.120, 000.\nThe monthly salary of a Deputy Minister is set to increase from Rs.63,500 to Rs 135,000, while the salaries drawn by Ministers and State Ministers would increase from Rs.65,000 to Rs.140,000.\nIn addition to all this, since 2016 each and every member of Parliament receives a Rs 100,000 office allowance and a Rs. 50,000 phone allowance. Not forgetting the myriad of perks and benefits enjoyed by those in the Government.\nIt is not surprising that the move to increase the salaries of members of Parliament has been met with outrage by the members of the general public who are requested to tighten their belts because of the enormous debt burden that the current government says it has to deal with, at every possible occasion.\nGOOD GOVERNANCE\nMinister of Home Affairs Vajira Abeywardene attended an event in Kegalle today and as he was leaving the location of the event, he was questioned by Journalists. The question that was posed was simple “how fair is it to increase salaries by 215% when the economy is in such a state.” The Minister no doubt shocked and taken aback by the report that he stands to receive a pay rise, simply walked away smiling with his index finger pressed to his lips, as if to say shhh! don’t jinx it.\nFormer Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage speaking to the media noted that it is unfair to increase the salaries of Parliamentarians in a backdrop where taxes imposed on the general public keeps rising.\nAddressing a media briefing General Secretary of the United National Freedom Front, Maithri Gunratne questioned if this is what the current administration classifies as “good governance.” Gunaratne spoke about the actions of Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who proposed a 20% pay cut for all parliamentarians taking into consideration the status of the economy. He noted that the situation in Sri Lanka is completely different.\nMinister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera was also questioned by the media on Thursday (Aug 2nd) on the reports of a possible salary increase for MPs. Minister Samaraweera noted that personally, he is against the salaries of anyone being increased at this current point of time. He noted that whatever discussions are held, the final decision has to come through him.\nIt is admirable that the Minister of Finance feels this way in a personal capacity, however, can he withstand pressure from his peers and superiors when the time comes to make the crucial decision. Will it be country before self or vice versa?",

While the aim of refurbishing the Ratmalana Airport is well intended for sure, it is quite dubious on whether Sri Lanka has an urgent need for ‘another’ international airport.\nThe Katunayake airport is undergoing resurfacing of its runway. According to Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited, future projects planned for the Katunayake airport, include a second runway to support the Airbus A380, a further eight passenger gates, a domestic terminal, a five-storeyed car-park, and a five-star hotel neighbouring the airport.\nWith all the refurbishments to the Katunayake Airport included, it is a fair question to be raised as to why Sri Lanka plans to invest in upgrading the Ratmalana Domestic airbase, given the current economy and debt situation of the country.\nLEARNING FROM PAST MISTAKES\nIf we recall, the Good Governance Government came into power to rectify certain unaccounted decisions made by the previous regime. This includes the unwarranted construction of the Mattala airport, which is reported to be the World’s emptiest airport. Given the circumstances, it is questionable whether the current administration has learned anything from the mistakes of the past administration.\nMinister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala De Silva was questioned at a press conference, whether the refurbishment of the Ratmalana airbase is an attempt to sell off the airport, like the Government’s plans for the Mattala airport. Min. Nimal Siripala seemed a bit agitated by the question as he fired back rhetorical questions at the journalists. He stated emphatically that there is no idea of selling the Ratmalana airport or the Mattala Airport.\nIn a speech given at the parliament on 6 June 2018, Min. Nimal Siripala, speaking on the Mattala airport, states that a project plan was put forward by the Indian Airport Authority, to be initiated as a Joint Venture. He states that the discussion was on establishing a separate controlling legal entity (Private company) by the Sri Lankan Government and the Indian Airport Authority, where the Indian Authority plans to buy 70% of the shares of the newly established company. According to Min. Nimal Siripala the discussions with India are ongoing and the parties haven’t reached a decision yet. He also reassures that the 70% equity investment by the Indian Airport Authority could be used in servicing the debt of the country.\nHowever, claims that the Indian Airport Authority was interested in the Mattala airport was rejected by the Indian Minister of State for Civil Aviation in the Lok Sabha recently.\nANOTHER WHITE-ELEPHANT?\nA rational question that arises is where Sri Lanka would find the funds necessary to develop the Rathmalana airport, is it through another loan or through some Government fund. Either way is this really how the Government should invest this money given the current situation of the economy and the cost of living?\nThe question is will the Rathmala Airport become the Good Governance Government’s Mattala.",

        "content": "Colombo (News1st) – A release issued by the media unit of the Speaker of Parliament notes that a final decision has not been reached with regard to the increase of salaries for the MPs and Ministers.\nThe release notes that as per a Parliamentary proposal passed on the 23rd of November 2006 it had been decided to increase the salaries of MPs and Ministers to match those of Judges in higher courts. In accordance with this proposal, the salaries of Parliamentarians should increase each time the justices receive a salary increment.\nFollowing the recent salary increment granted to members of the judiciary, the speaker had received requests to ensure that the salaries of all parliamentarians are also increased. The release by the Speaker’s media unit notes that the Speaker had passed on these requests, along with his recommendations, to the General Secretary of Parliament.\nThe release further notes that a decision on whether they should follow the precedent set in 2006 or deviate from it will be reached following discussions with the party leaders.\nPOLITICIANS REACT\nAddressing a public gathering in Colombo today UNP MP S.M.Marrikar revealed that the request for a salary increment was put forward by Gunawardena, a party leader of the Joint Opposition. He noted that the proposal to ensure that judges and parliamentarians receive the same salaries was brought forward in 2003 by late Jeyraj Fernadapulle. Marrikar questioned how ethical it is to ask for a salary increment at a time when the people of this country are going through a tough time adding that this salary increment should be refused.\nConvenor of the Citizen’s Voice for a Just Society, Chandrasena Wijeysinghe expressing his views on the reports of salary increments for parliamentarians listed out a number of allowances that they receive.\nWijeysinghe states that all parliamentarians receive a\n\nRs 100,000 – Office allowance\nA minimum of Rs 30,949 as a fuel allowance\nRs 50,000 – Telephone allowance\nRs 10,000 – Private office allowance\nRs 2500/day – for attendance in Parliament\n\nWijeysinghe claims that if all these allowances are taken into consideration each parliamentarian receives a minimum of Rs 266,234. The Citizens voice for a just society believes that these salaries could be slash by 50%.\nMinister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera addressing a public gathering explained that he does not support a salary increment for parliamentarians.\nUPFA Parliamentarian Kanchana Wijeysekara believes that the Government should focus on doubling the Samurdhi benefits (currently Rs 2500) before thinking about increasing the salaries of Parliamentarians. The Joint Opposition member noted that it is a joke to bring such proposal to parliament without increasing the salaries of the working masses.  Kanchana Wijeysekara notes that as the Joint Opposition they officially oppose this move.\nDeputy Minister of Environment Ajith Mannaperuma expressing his views stated that this proposal was brought forward during a party leaders meeting and went on to state that this proposal could have been brought forward by the Joint Opposition themselves as they were represented in the meeting by MP Dinesh Gunawardene.",

Prices of goods increase by the day while the rupee depreciated to a record low in the not too distant past, not forgetting that interest rates increased by 03% as well.\nIsn’t the looting of public funds from the Central Bank Treasury Bond Scam the main reason for these aggravating issue that burden the general public?\nThe immediate loss from the 1st Bond Issue dated the 27th of February 2015 was estimated by the Auditor General as over Rs. 896 Million. It now stated that by the end of the maturity period of 30 years for this bond, the loss to the state will be in the Billions and could even reach the level of Trillions of rupees.\nThe most dangerous aspect of this Bond Scam is that those involved had tampered with the Employees Provident Fund. The EPF is where the working masses deposit a portion of their hard earned monthly salary – shedding blood, sweat, and tears for many years. Sadly, the money which the people hope of taking back when they reach retirement too had been looted from this scam and its reach is such that it had forced taxes to be imposed on the remainder of the fund.\nThe loss caused by the first bond scam has been revealed thus far. However, while the investigations on the bond scam took place, in 2016 another bond scam took place, and loss caused by this is far greater than the first.\nSpeaking to the media the Executive director of the CaFFE Keerthi Tennakoon said it is clear that the information relating to the Second Bond Scam was limited when it was inquired by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry. He said it must be made clear that the financial fraud of over Rs. 11 Billion is only connected to the first bond scam.\nKeerthi Tennakoon added that they are attempting to state the total loss of around Rs. 12 Billion and there is no truth to this, it has affected the funds of the Unversity Grants Commission, the Mahapola, Central Bank Funds, the EPF, the ETF, the National Saving Bank, the People’s Bank as well as the Insurance Corporation. The total loss from this scam is Rs. 32 BIllion Rupees or even more, said Keerthi Tennakoon adding that investigations must take place with regard to this second bond scam.",

In 2006 the Government of Sri Lanka owned 51.05% of the shares of SriLankan Airlines, while Emirates-owned 43.63% and others owned 5.32%.\nHowever, in 2010 an understanding had been reached to sell the 43.63% shares of Emirates to the Government of Sri Lanka. This is evident in a letter addressed to Former Secretary of Finance Dr. P.B. Jayasundara from the Chairman of Emirates Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum.\nAt the time the Government Valuation Department had determined that the Government-owned shares were valued at 450 Million US Dollars. It was said today that Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Minister of Finance had produced a memorandum to the Cabinet on the 1st of June 2010 and it notes that approval was granted to Bank of Ceylon (BOC) to explore the possibility in purchasing the Emirates shares for 53 Million US Dollars.\nAccording to the documents, on the 20th of June 2010 – 22,451,516 shares owned by Emirates were transferred to BOC for 53 Million US Dollars. What is surprising is that as of 30th August 2010 when SriLankan registered the shares, BOC had 12,115,517 shares, People’s Bank 4,236,135 shares, National Savings Bank 4,236,135 shares, and the EPF had 1,863,676 shares.\nHowever, there is no Cabinet Paper available to say that the Treasury approved the other state institutions to purchase the Emirates shares, despite the fact that the Cabinet only approved Bank of Ceylon to purchase the shares.\nSECURITY VIOLATION?\nTitus Kannangara the Senior Manager Security and Investigations at SriLankan Airlines Ltd. testifying today said it took the national carrier almost two and a half years to install an X-Ray scanning system at the Katunayake Airport.\nHe said the original tender was canceled in 2014 citing an alleged security threat from the LTTE and the three X-Ray devices were only installed at the airport in 2016 & 2017. The airline had entered into individual 07-year service agreements with the supplier for Explosive Trace Detectors (ETD) and all of them were signed on the 31st of August 2016 by Major General ( Rtd.) P. Chandrawansa, the Head of Group Security.\nThe ETDs were installed at the airport on the 15th of August 2016, two weeks before the service agreement was even signed. What should be noted is that the contract review form, which is a document signed by other user departments vetting the procurement, had been signed on the 18th of May 2016.\nThe issue highlighted by the Attorney Generals Department is that the user departments had approved the procurement even before the ETDs were shipped to Sri Lanka.\nTitus Kannangara also confirmed that the HR Department at SriLankan Airlines requested him to release on 07 security personnel attached to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya, who were on duty, for election campaigning in Pelmadulla on the 27th of December 2014, for the political party that was in power at the time.\nThe Collective bargaining agreement between the trade union and SriLankan Airlines clearly notes personnel cannot be released for any political activity.",

        "content": "Colombo (News1st) – On Monday details were revealed about a Rs. 10bn loan obtained from the People’s bank by a director of the bank for a private company which he is involved in. On Tuesday the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union officially inquired from the People’s Bank on the Rs. 10bn loan.\nThe Deshaya weekend newspaper reported on Sunday that the Rs. 10bn loan was granted to a company affiliated with the Director of People’s Bank. Upon further investigations conducted by News 1st, it was revealed that the loan was approved by the Loans Committee of People’s Bank where Jehan Amaratunge is a Board Member, for MTD Walkers PLC, where he holds the position of Executive Deputy Chairman,.\nGeneral Secretary of the Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union, Ranjan Senanayake speaking to News1st explained that they had made a written inquiry to the administration of the People’s Bank to ascertain whether the necessary procedures were followed in issuing this loan.\nOFFICIAL EXPLANATION\nIssuing a release on Tuesday to make clarifications on the matter, Chairman of People’s Bank Hemasiri Fernando said MTD Walkers PLC have had trusted dealings with the People’s Bank since 2004, adding the repayments for the constant financial lendings it granted were carried out in a proper and systematic manner. The People’s Bank Chairman points out the loan facility was awarded in adherence to the regulations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.\nHemasiri Fernando’s release says the loan was granted with the approval of the Board of Directors in accordance with the recommendations of the Board’s Loans Committee which comprises of three members of the bank’s Board of Directors and Senior Officials of the Loan Board. The People’s Bank Chairman goes on to note the Board of Directors approved the loan only after ensuring that all requirements of the Central Bank were met.\nHemasiri Fernando had stressed that when granting loan facilities, the People’s Bank only takes into account the proper procedure and not the recommendations or interferences of any other person or institution.\nMeanwhile, former People’s Bank Chairman Rusiripala Tennakoon says he has received reports that a Rs. 1bn loan granted to MTD Walkers PLC was classified as a non-performing loan on the 29th of July. He revealed that the People’s Bank had invested Rs. 500mn in MTD Walkers PLC debentures at an interest rate of 9.75%. Rusiripala Tennakoon says this is a considerably low-interest rate adding that a state bank making an investment at such a low-interest rate is questionable.\nAs at the 31st of December 2015, People’s Bank was the 4th largest shareholder of MTD Walkers PLC. Niranjan Deva Aditya who is a close associate of the Prime Minister is also an Independent Non-Executive Director of this company.\nThe leader of the National Unity Alliance, Azath Salley commenting on the matter noted that there is nothing the board of directors of the People’s bank could do as this incident was about Jehan Amaratunge who is a friend of Minister Malik Samarawickrama. Salley accused the Samarawickrama of using his influence to pass this loan through both the bank and the central bank.\nDéjà vu\nDo you remember how the Central Bank Treasury Bond Scam took place? It has now been proven that the father-in-law from with the Central Bank acted in a manner that benefited his son-in-law to the tune of billions of public funds.\nIsn’t it a conflict of interest when a Director of a State Bank approves a loan for another company he is affiliated with? What is the collateral the bank received when granting a loan of  Rs. 10bn?\nMore details to follow.",

        "content": "COLOMBO (News 1st) – Three years ago the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, under Governor Arjuna Mahendran, advertised a bond of Rs. 1 Billion for 30 years. Despite the passage of time, there is a remarkable absence of legal action being taken.\n\nAlthough the advertised amount was Rs. 1 Billion and the Public Debt Department recommended that an amount Rs. 2.06 Billion be taken up after the bids were received, then Governor Arjuna Mahendran acted in what turned out to be wrongful, improper, mala fide, fraudulent and in gross breach of his duties as Governor.\n\nThe principal beneficiary of these deviant actions by the governor was a company named Perpetual Treasuries Limited which just happened to be owned and controlled by the family of his son in law Arjun Aloysius. After News 1st highlighted growing concerns of a conflict of interest and a departure from a procedure on the 16th of March 2015, Arjuna Mahendran admitted his liability on one aspect of this scam.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with News1st, Mahendran admitted that he should have advertised for 10 billion rupees instead of one. The very next day (March 17th, 2015), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a statement in Parliament. He said he insisted on a public auction because private placements had led to corruption and lack of transparency. In this statement, the Prime Minister as the Minister in charge of the Central Bank told Parliament that it was he who insisted on the change in the way that bonds be awarded.\n\nThereafter the Prime Minister appointed a three-member Committee of UNP loyalists ( the Pitipana Committee) who had no knowledge of CBSL operations. Following the conclusion of this committee’s activities, COPE investigated the matter – where Mahendran admitted that he “only did as he was instructed to by the Prime Minister”. The Second COPE observed that Arjuna Mahendran was accountable for the loss.\n\nIn the face of growing public concern and civil society calls President Sirisena appointed a Presidential Commission of inquiry headed by two Supreme Court Judges. 11 Months later, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry handed in its report to the President. This was in a backdrop of claims that Bond Report had found its way to a private residence prior to reaching the Presidential Palace and serious claims that a certain number of pages of this report are hidden or are being kept hidden.\n\nIn a complete departure from process and procedure, President’s Secretary Austin Fernando decided to archive the entire report, ensuring that the report is kept away from public eyes for the next 30 years. Incidentally the first bond had its maturity date in 30 years.\n\nDuring the Presidential Commission’s proceedings, the Prime Minister was asked to appear as a witness and instead of a personal initial appearance he was sent a questionnaire and expected to reply in the form of an affidavit. When the Prime Minister did turn up at the commission, it was the Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya himself who questioned him, not individuals such as Yasantha Kodagoda or Dappula De Livera who had been thorough in their examination of other witnesses. The Attorney General’s questioning of the Prime Minister was met with strong criticism from the legal fraternity.\n\nMinisters Malik Samarawickrama and Kabir Hashim were questioned only for a few minutes and their questioning too attracted criticism.\nA SERIOUS ANOMALY\nPrime Minister Wickremesinghe on the 17th of March 2015 admitted he insisted on the change in the way the bonds are issued.  Arjuna Mahendran appearing before COPE stated he only followed the PMs instructions. Yet, the Bond Report does not address directly the PMs admission and Mahedran’s concurrence on the very subject.\n\nThe Commission has recommended legal action against Arjuna Mahendran, several officials of CBSL, Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena of PTL and several others.\n\nThe Director General of the Bribery Commission Sarath Jayamanne has openly stated that the existing laws do not permit the commission to use the evidence from the Bond Commission in any prosecution. The proposed amendment to the laws has to be passed by Parliament where the matter has not even been given a debate thus far.\n\nIt is remarkable that this entire exercise apart from being a conflict of interest scenario does not enjoy the serious attention of elected Parliamentarians to enable a change in the law and therefore the prosecution.\n\nAll this is in a backdrop where the second bond issuance, seven times the amount of the first, remains uninvestigated.",

The report adds that the loan facility has been approved at multiple stages and had also received the approval of the bank’s board of directors and loans committee.\nWhen the Deshaya newspaper had made inquiries from the Chairman of the State Bank, he had confirmed the report of the loan adding that the loan had gone through the proper channels.

So the man (Arjuna Mahendran) scooted off to Singapore. It was Ranil who protected him after the theft and it was Ranil who helped him flee the country as well. So does this not make him the person behind the theft? What other proof do you need? This kind of evidence is not detrimental to a case. There is something called circumstantial evidence based on which the court can make a decision. Which is why I say Ranil is directly involved in this deal..”\nIt is well known that the bond scam caused monumental losses to Sri Lanka. It is the largest incident of defrauding state funds in the political history of the country. Through parliament, civil society, the Committee on Public Enterprises and the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, the manner in which this crime was carried out and the perpetrators, were exposed.\nWhile this is the major topic of conversation on the political stage, on whose interference is the recovery of these funds and the punishment of the perpetrators being delayed continuously?\nThe people do not want to listen to stories anymore – they want the perpetrators to be punished.\nThe people are watching.",

The verite research findings on which we based our reporting also reveals that there prevails an issue in ascertaining the true owner of the Lakdhanavi Limited because of the complications surrounding the other entities and factions that claim ownership.\nAt a time when no payment had been made to the CEB for the massive risk undertaken by the Government of Sri Lanka, 39.75 % of the dividends had been paid to Lakdhanavi Limited which only owns 4.8 % of the shares. When the numbers are compared it is clear that while the Government had placed a guarantee for a 22.7 Billion Rupee loan, other partners had conveniently made profits in billions.\nWhen the agreement was being prepared to purchase electricity from Lakdhanavi Limited, the Ceylon Electricity Board had acted in a manner that raised serious doubts.\nIn the agreement, articles that directly provide a benefit to the company in question had been agreed upon without any hesitation, while the articles that bring a profit to the CEB have been disregarded in a manner that raises a red flag.\nAccording to the report, Lakdhanavi Limited had only infused a capital of 02 % while owning only 05 % of shares but has still made massive profits. However, it had acted in an immoral manner disregarding the Government of Sri Lanka which took a massive risk and infused 98 % of the Capital.\nIssues surrounding LTL Holdings and its subsidiaries have been directed to the attention of the responsible authorities on previous occasions. The matters exposed in the COPE Reports of the 08th Parliament are astounding as well.\nAccording to COPE, though the CEB held 63 % of shares of LTL Holding, the CEB had limited control over the operations of the company. It was in 2016 that COPE warned that when LTL and its subsidiaries enjoy massive dividends, the percentage given to the CEB could drop drastically.\nAccording to the Auditor General’s Deratment, the CEB should have recieved Rs. 7,184mn as dividends in 2016. However, the books in the CEB only record a figure of 6952 Million Rupees as dividends. Can this be expected from a Government that was elected to power to simply oppose corruption?\nWhat would be the response of individuals like – Power and Energy Ministry Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda and CEB Chairman B.Ganegala, who served as a head of LTL Holdings with, Aruna Kumarasinghe, U.D.Jaywardena, MJMN Marikkar, Ravindra Pitigalage and others?\nThe people are watching.",

Two youth had climbed to the top of a tree as a mark of protest.\nWhen Chamal Rajapaksa had arrived at the location of the event he had tried to convince the people of the village that the former president had found it unable to be present because he had just returned from Singapore after medication and that he is currently in Tangalle. However, the villagers continued to protest.\nIn order to control the situation, Chamal Rajapaksa had contacted Mahinda Rajapaksa over the phone and provided an opportunity to one of the youth to speak with the Former President. The unveiling of the Buddha Statue never took place and Chamal Rajapaksa also left the premises shortly afterward.",

It was later leased out in 2015 for the construction of what is considered the largest technological city in the country Trace Expert City.\nTrace Expert City was built on 7 acres of the 10-acre plot of land owned by the Urban Development Authority. The debate, however, is on the car park of Trace Expert City.\nThe detailed designing of the railway project funded by the Asian Development Bank, to be initiated in Colombo and its suburbs is currently underway. A request was made for this particular plot of land to be used as the site for the construction of the Colombo Railway control Centre and the Chief operations center.\nA group of employees of the Railway department had attempted to separate the plot of land using a fence last evening.\nDr. Jagath Munasinghe, Chairman of the Urban Development Authority(UDA) stated that they proposed a better-suited location to construct the Railway control Centre rather than the plot of land used for the car park of Trace Expert city. However, during this negotiation, the employees had started opposing the deal and launched a Trade Union Action in order to gain ownership of the land.\nHowever, when inquired, a senior official of the Railway project being implemented in Colombo and its suburbs said that cabinet approval has been granted for the construction of Colombo Railway control Centre and the Chief operations center. He added that the construction of the fence yesterday was done after all relevant stakeholders were informed.\nAccording to the State Minister of National Policies and Economic affairs, Dr. Harsha De Silva none of the stakeholders had been informed of the decision. He noted that the Prime Minister and Minister Nimal Siripala weren’t aware that the plot of land in the plan was in the middle of the IT park. He went on to state that there should be a separate discussion on this as there is ambiguity on the awareness of the cabinet.\nDr. Harsha further states that, as the feasibility study is not due for some time and the loan is to be passed in 2019, the discussion should not be rushed and that they reasonably request for this to be done after discussions with minister Nimal Siripala and all other interested parties and after they are properly informed.",

        "content": "Colombo (News1st) :  A study done by Verite Research has exposed that the Government of Sri Lanka had taken a massive risk and made investments using public funds in the electricity sector, with no benefit. This transaction dates back to 2006. A firm by the name West Coast (Pvt) Ltd had been formed for the construction of the 300 MW Kerawalapitiya Combined Cycle Power Plant. Initially, it had been decided that the main shareholder of this company should be Lakdhanavi Ltd.\nA majority share of Lakdhanavi Ltd is owned by Lanka Transformers Limited (LTL is a company in which the Ceylon Electricity Board holds a majority share). However, it is the government that had given a guarantee to secure a 22.7 Billion Rupee loan facility from HSBC for this project.\nThe government had also intervened to secure more funding for the project – 2.9 Billion Rupees from the National Savings Bank and another 2.9 Billion Rupees from the Employees Provident Fund.\nAccording to the Foreign Loans Act of Sri Lanka, if a guarantee is given by the Government of Sri Lanka relating to a foreign loan for a project, the state should have 50 percent stake in the project. The study has revealed, that the 50 percent share of West Coast (Pvt) Ltd had been temporarily vested with the government on 14 separate occasions to fulfill the aforementioned criteria.\nAs of March 2011, the Government owned the 50 percent shares of West Coast (Pvt) Ltd, while 18.2 percent was owned by Lanka Electricity Company Private Limited which is owned by the CEB, another 27.1 percent was owned by the EPF and the other 4.8 percent was owned by Lakdhanavi Ltd.\nA startling factor in this expose, is that for the guarantee, no dividends were paid to the Government of Sri Lanka.However, dividends had been paid to Lakdhanavi Ltd, LECO, and the EPF.\nThe method of payment is an astounding factor in this misappropriation of funds;\nAccordingly, Lakdhanavi Ltd which owns only 4.8 percent of shares had been paid a dividend of 39.75 percent. The EPF which owns 27.1 percent of shares was paid a dividend of 20.04 percent. LECO which owned 18.2 percent of shares was paid a dividend of 20.4 percent.\nAdding to this, an agreement had been reached for the 50 percent shares owned by the Government to be vested with Lakdhanavi Ltd once the entire loan amount is paid off.\nThe research study also revealed that the Ceylon Electricity Board does not own 48.5 percent of shares in West Coast (Pvt.) Ltd.\nLeft Centre Convenor Chameera Perera states with regards to the energy sector revelations, this scam is far greater than the Central Bank Treasury Bond Scam and that a Presidential Commission should conduct independent inquiries regarding these massive scams.",

However, procuring equipment in the Approval List is a risk that has to be borne by the purchaser.\nThe CAA has confirmed that the ETDs were from procured from the Grandfather lists. What is even more startling is that these two ETDs lifespan end in February next year.\nWhen SriLankan airlines had submitted applications for certification, the CAA had only issues permits for one year which lapsed in February this year following the commitment made by Retired Major General P. Chandrawansa that SriLankan airlines adheres to the standards.\nYet, even as of today, SriLankan Airlines had not made a single application for re-certification and it is operating with equipment rejected by the entire aviation industry.\nWhen asked if this situation poses a security threat, the CAA noted, as a result, they are continuously monitoring the ETDs.\nIt was also revealed, that Retired Major General P.

And among them was Siva Ramachandran, who was then based in the UK.\nInterestingly, SriLankan Airlines had conducted three other in-person interviews for three others namely Manoj De Vaas Gunawardena, W.Kumarasiri and Suren Ratwatte.\nIn August 2015, after the interviews, Rakhita Jayawardena, the Protem Chief Executive Officer and Director at SriLankan Airlines and had informed the board that Suren Ratwatte was the best suited for the post and he offered a 03 Million Rupee taxable monthly pay and a 10 Million Rupees taxable performance bonus.\nIt must be noted there was no board decision on appointing Suren Ratwatte as CEO, however, he was given the appointment on 22nd of September 2015 with a 06 month probation period. Ratwatte’s 06 month probation period was to end on the 15th of April 2016, however, the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development had proposed Ratwatte be given another 06-month extension to his service.\nSurprisingly, when his probation drew to a close, no performance evaluation was done because the Prime Minister and Kabir Hashim requested that Suren Ratwatte be confirmed as CEO as soon as possible.\nEarlier this year News 1st reported with facts that the view of some members of the Board of Directors was that Suren Ratwatte’s service was not efficient and it needed to be suspended. News 1st also reported that SriLankan Airlines, which proposed a performance bonus of 10 Million rupees to Suren Ratwatte, suffered a loss of 28.2 Billion Rupees during the financial year 2016/2017.\nSuren Ratwatte’s pre-mature retirement is in effect from the 31st of July 2018 and in today’s evidence, it was revealed that new Chairman Ranjith Fernando had accepted his resignation and offered to pay 03 Months pay as well as additional 02 months pay for cooperating with the company’s restructuring plan. In addition, he is to be given air tickets for his family to travel to Australia.\nIn a letter to the Chairman of the Airline on his resignation, Suren Ratwatte requested for a payment equivalent to six months salary says the income tax will be the responsibility of SriLankan Airlines. He had noted all Final Payments must be remitted in Australian Dollars to his offshore accounts.\nThe Presidential Commission of Inquiry must be appreciated for focusing on those who have brought this airline to the brink of bankruptcy and raising serious matters of concern.\nIt has been revealed that Siva Ramachandran was appointed as the Chief Commercial Office of SriLankan Airlines with no board approval.\nThe evidence revealed today that the Chairman of the Airlines had believed the appointment had Cabinet approval, simply because Advisor to the Prime Minister R. Paskaralingam had reported that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management had found no fault with the selection process. This is revealed in a letter sent by Prime Minister’s Secretary Saman Ekanayake to the Ministry of Finance.\nIt is now clear that the appointments of Suren Ratwatte and Siva Ramachandran were a departure of due process just as it was with the case with the Central Bank Treasury Bond Scam.",

        "content": "The country’s senate voted last week to require search companies to hand over access to their search algorithms to ensure that rivals are treated fairly. The search companies would also have to post links to three competitor search engines on their search results pages.\nThough the law would apply to all search engines, it is clearly aimed at Google (GOOGL, Tech30) — the company has a 90% share of the search market in France.\n“We’re transparent about what ranks well on Google, including when we make changes, but by definition, not everyone can come at the top of the rankings,” said Google spokeswoman Caroline Matthews. “Revealing our algorithms – our intellectual property – would lead to the gaming of our results, which would be a bad experience for users.”\nThe bill is unlikely to become law, because the government of President François Hollande is opposed to it. It was introduced as an amendment to a bill designed to grow the French economy that reportedly will go up for a wider vote in France’s National Assembly later this month. A preliminary version of the amendment was declared unconstitutional, before it was tweaked.\nThe vote came just a day after the European Union filed serious antitrust charges against Google. The search company faces a fine of up to $6 billion — more than a quarter’s worth of profits. It also could have to change the way it displays search results in the EU.\nIt’s just the latest in a string of unfavorable rulings for Google in Europe.\nLast year, the European Parliament voted in favor of a nonbinding resolution to break up the company. Parliaments in Spain, France and Germany passed laws that allow publishers to charge Google when snippets of their stories land in Google News — and the news service shut down in Spain as a result. And Google lost its battle over the “right to be forgotten,” a European law that requires the company to remove certain unwanted, inappropriate links from search results if requested.\nGoogle is particularly protective of its search algorithm — the secret sauce that helped propel the company to search dominance over the past decade. If the bill passes and Google opts not to share its algorithm, it might consider ceasing operations in France. Google’s search engine would still be available in France, but its servers would be located in another country.\nIt would be an extreme measure that the company has so far reserved for China. In 2010, Google removed its servers and business from mainland China, placing them in Hong Kong instead. That allowed Google to provide the Chinese with search results without the onus of censoring the results according to Chinese law (the Chinese government now censors the results themselves).\nSource : CNN",

The JHU too hopes to discuss this with other parties including the SLFP and take the necessary steps.\nLeader of the Democratic Party Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka noted that the committee appointed comprises of several selfish persons. He said:\nThe Governor is not directly responsible – if people in other positions need to take responsibility then why pay a wage to the Governor and give him all the facilities by using taxpayers money. It does not serve any purpose for the country. There are people in this government who are trying to take the country back to where Percy Mahendra took it.",

She was quoted as saying, “With the Windows 10 launch at the end of July, we are watching sort of the impact of that on the back-to-school season, and expect that it might have a bit of a delay to the normal back-to-school season inventory build-up.”\nOf course AMD could simply be making a guess of their own and just giving a placeholder date, but given that this is an earnings call in which investors are involved, not to mention since AMD does make Windows-based computers, we suppose that they would be in the know with regards to Microsoft’s plans for releasing the platform.\nAt this point in time, Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system is still in its technical preview stage and it still feels like Microsoft has a lot of things left to do. However Microsoft’s next Build conference will be held later this month where presumably we will be getting more information with regards to its launch, so do check back with us then for the details.",

Gotabhaya believes that this will allow the country to get back on its feet.\nSpeaking to P.K. Balachandran of The New Indian Express the former defence secretary had claimed that Sri Lankans want Mahinda Rajapaksa in power, adding that support for the former President had grown beyond the 5.8 million votes he got in the January Presidential Election.\nIn his interview, the former defence Ssecretary claims that there is no functioning government as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike and several other ministers are vying for power within the present government. He goes on to state that all economic development projects initiated by the Rajapaksa regime have come to a standstill and that over 100,000 workers have been rendered jobless as a result of this.\nRajapaksa claims that civil servants are frightened to make decisions as officials are currently being investigated by the government for alleged procedural lapses. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa warns that if this trend is allowed to continue, the entire economy would collapse and it would be difficult to put the country back on its feet.\nResponding to the corruption charges levelled against him the former defence secretary denied the allegations as baseless, stating that he had earned money for the country through his projects.",

According to reports, the IPL governing council, headed by Rajeev Shukla has not accepted this valuation. The issue is expected to be discussed during Sunday’s BCCI working committee meeting.\nChennai Super Kings and their owners have been under the scanner ever since the 2013 IPL match-fixing and betting scandal broke. Gurunath Meiyappan, a team owner and the son-in-law of former Board chief N. Srinivasan, has been indicted by a Supreme Court panel for betting and sharing team information. A US company valued CSK to over Rs 450 crore last season.\nIn January, the Supreme Court brought charges of “conflict of interest” against Srinivasan. The charges denied Srinivasan from contesting the BCCI presidential elections. Acting on the court order, India Cements, the original owners of the CSK, transferred shares to Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd.\nIndia Cements Board decided that the subsidiary will be owned by existing shareholders on a proportionate basis. While 70 per cent of India Cements shares are held by public, promoters hold 28 per cent and N Srinivasan holds 0.14 per cent of the shares.\nReports suggest that the IPL governing council is not happy with CSK’s new value and has not ratified the transfer of shares. As per the BCCI rules, 5 per cent of the sale price of any team must be given to the BCCI. Effectively, BCCI will get Rs 25,000 only.\nCSK and their owners are still under the Supreme Court scanner. The new ‘value’ will generate more controversy for sure.\nSource: NDTV",

Also we say it clearly and with much responsibility that there are certain environmental  groups, certain activists and certain non-governmental organisations which have acquired powers that are greater than the powers of the relevant minister and deputy minister.\nIt is very clear that the underlying objective of these elements is to remove elephants from the perehera culture. Therefore, we have decided that until this issue is resolved none of our members will be releasing elephants for pereheras.",

        "content": "Google Inc reported higher quarterly revenue and profit as rising online ad volume offset a hit from the strong dollar, sending the Internet company’s shares higher in after-hours trading.\nShares of the world’s No. 1 Internet search engine rose after the results were released, climbing 3.5 percent on Thursday to $577.\nWhile revenue and profit missed the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, many investors had been bracing for a weaker report, said BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis.\nThe company has faced challenges in mobile advertising and is running up more expenses as it invests in new businesses.\n“The concern was that the first quarter results could have been much worse,” Gillis said. “There’s a certain degree of relief rally happening.”\nRevenue for the quarter that ended in March rose 12 percent to $17.26 billion, from $15.42 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $17.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe rising dollar took a toll on results at Google, which generates about half of its revenue overseas.\n“Excluding the net impact of foreign currency headwinds, revenue grew a healthy 17 percent year on year,” Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette said in a statement.\nThe number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 13 percent, while the average price of online ads, or “cost per click,” declined 7 percent.\nGoogle’s ad revenue has been pressured as more consumers access its online services on mobiles devices such as smartphones and tablets, where ad rates are typically lower.\nIn a conference call, Pichette highlighted mobile ads as a key source of revenue growth during the quarter. “We are experiencing real strength in mobile search,” he said.\nThe contribution of ad revenue from video platform YouTube “continues to grow at a strong rate year-over year,” he added. Brands are embracing YouTube’s TrueView service, where advertisers pay only when users opt not to skip an ad, he said.\nGoogle’s advertising sales in the first quarter rose 11 percent to $15.51 billion. (bit.ly/1OLAPb8)\nThe company, under increasing competition for mobile ad dollars from rivals such as Facebook Inc, tweaked its algorithm for mobile searches on Tuesday to favor sites that look good on smartphone screens. (bit.ly/1yMzbno)\nEarlier this month, the European Union accused Google of abusing its dominance of Internet searches to push its own products.\nNet income rose to $3.59 billion, or $5.20 per share, from $3.45 billion, or $5.04 per share.\nExcluding items, the company earned $6.57 per share, just missing analysts’ forecast of $6.60.\nSource: Reuters",

It was put on temporary display at the department store.\nToshiba says Chihira has 43 motors allowing it to move, speak in sign language and even sing.\nThe regular greeter, Ayako Seiryu, says she’s not worried about a robot replacing her — even one made to resemble a real 32-year-old woman.\n“Communication is important,” she says. “My strength is I can actually talk to people.”\nChihira can’t have a conversation yet, acknowledges Hitoshi Tokuda, Toshiba spokesperson. But he says the technology is evolving quickly and someday, robots like Chihira could replace humans for certain jobs.\nA growing number of Japanese businesses are testing out robots as a possible solution to the country’s shrinking workforce.\nThey’re appearing in stores, banks and soon even hotels. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ is trying out “Nao,” a customer service robot that answers basic questions and is designed to speak 19 languages. The robotic polygot could prove useful serving foreign customers during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nBy then, the bank hopes to have even more robots on staff.\n“Pepper” is a humanoid robot that “chats” with customers. A humanoid has human-like characteristics such as arms, legs and a head — but is designed to look like a robot. Pepper first began appearing in Tokyo stores last year.\nManufacturer Softbank hopes it’ll eventually be a “family robot,” like a sleeker version of Rosie on “The Jetsons.”\nMeet Pepper — the world’s first emo robot\nA hotel scheduled to open at Huis Ten Bosch theme park in Nagasaki this summer plans to have 10 robot staff members and aims to increase that to more than 90% of hotel services operated by robots.\nToday’s novelty could be tomorrow’s necessity. Japan has an aging population that has prompted serious talks about how to incorporate robots into the nation’s shrinking workforce.\nOne group that seems willing to embrace robots are Japan’s senior citizens.\nA survey by nursing home operator Orix Living found more seniors would feel comfortable being cared for by a robot than a foreign nurse.\nIn a nation with a dwindling population, waning workforce, and deep resistance to immigration, it seems robots will only play a larger role in Japan’s future.\nBy Will Ripley\n-CNN",

Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. The mayor of Baltimore said every possible resource was being deployed to “gain control of this situation.”\n“What we see tonight that is going on in our city is very disturbing,” Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake told reporters. “Too many people have spent generations building up this city for it to be destroyed by thugs who — in a very senseless way — are trying to tear down what so many have fought for.”\nShe announced that the city will impose a mandatory curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. daily, effective for one week starting Tuesday. The mayor also promised to hold those responsible for the violence accountable.\nMore than two dozen people have already been arrested, according to Col. Darryl D. DeSousa with the Baltimore Police Department.\nHe said that 15 officers were injured. Two remain hospitalized, and the others have been released. Most were hurt by flying debris in the violence that DeSousa described as “unprecedented.”\nVideo showed police in riot gear taking cover behind an armored vehicle, as protesters pelted them with rocks.\nAt one point, it looked like officers used tear gas. The Baltimore Police Department said it had heard reports of protesters setting small items on fire, and footage showed a cruiser in flames.\nVideo also showed people looting local stores, and an area CVS pharmacy was set on fire after it was ransacked. Thick dark smoke filled the streets.\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries among the rioters.\n“It is so frustrating that people think that this makes sense — to destroy our community,” said Rawlings-Blake. “People who live there, that are already hurting, are going to be the ones that pay.”\nEarlier in the day, the Baltimore Police Department said it had received a “credible threat” that gangs were teaming up to “take out” officers.\nIt did not say where the information came from, nor did it say whether the threat was tied to the recent death of Freddie Gray. Gray died in police custody under circumstances that remain unclear.\nHis death has sparked ongoing protests in Baltimore and raised long-simmering tensions between police and residents.\nGroups of violent criminals are continuing to throw rocks, bricks, and other items at police officers.\n— Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) April 28, 2015\n\n\nWe are deploying resources throughout the city to ensure residents are safe.

Therefore, if taken into consideration, the 12 million votes received by the two main candidates, it is clear that the people are in agreement for this amendment.

He went on to note that there is time until Tuesday, April 28 noon to resolve the problems presented by both parties.\nMinister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stated that they have accepted the Supreme Court’s decision and that they have decided to remove articles 42,43 and 44 which confer powers on the Prime Minister. The political parties have agreed to this.\nOpposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva noted that they are totally in agreement with the establishment of  independent commissions. But this constitution does not mention the provisions for removing a Prime Minister. He said that what was stated before was that there would be no MPs in the constitutional council; thus they proposed five MPs be appointed.\nJVP Propaganda Secretary MP Vijitha Herath stated that they are not in agreement with the entirety of the 19th Amendment which includes  consulting the Bar Association in the establishment of the Judicial Commission, but that they are in agreement with the primary intentions.",

The punishment mentioned in the amendment was a prison term of not more than three years and a fine not exceeding Rs.100,000.\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that an amendment was brought through clause 28 of the bill on the 19th Amendment which included that punishment on private telecasters, broadcasters and newspapers, in the event of failure to implement decisions of the Elections Commissioner.\nDiscussions were thus held with private media institutions, the President, Justice Minister, Media Minister and himself regarding the matter and they have thus decided to withdraw the clause.\nOpposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva stated that the initial draft bill that was presented did not contain any provisions on meting out punishment to media institutions.

The backdated eight month ban means that the former world number one will be able to take part in the 2016 Rio Olympics.\nLee Chong Wei’s test results came out as positive for the use of Dexamethasone during last year’s world championships. Even though Dexamethasone does not enhance performance, it is on the list of banned substances.\nLee, who has won 55 titles, at one point faced a two-year suspense but will be able to compete again on Friday after he voluntarily stood down last year after he was first told of the test results. The former world #1 as not played since losing last year’s World Championship final and witnessed his world rankings tumble all the way to 30th in the world\nThe Badminton World Federation (BWF) issued a statement saying that the panel, which consists of three members, is convinced this is not a case of doping with intent to cheat and further added that Lee had been negligent but the backdated sanction was “correct and fair”.\nThe BWF said that the banned anti-inflammatory drug, Dexamethasone, was found on the casing of gelatin capsules of a food supplement that Lee was taking.\nSpeaking at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Lee Chong Wei said that he is “relieved” with the backdated sanction and added that he will review back and might even be mentally stronger in the competitions to come.\nThe lengthy absence from the court which also led to his ranking tumbling down to 30th in the world could drop even further as his world championship final defeat to China’s Chen Long has been disqualified by the BWF and the silver medal has been rescinded.\nLee was allowed to keep the two Asian Games bronze medals he won in Incheon, South Korea, in September as he was not aware of his failed test during the time.\nLee will be free to take part in the May 10-17 Sudirman Cup, one of the first events with qualifying points for the Rio Games as the qualifying campaign for Rio begins on the 4th of May.\nThe former world #1 is also likely to take part in the Southeast Asian Games in June, prior to the World Championship in Jakarta in August.\nDespite the unfortunate turn of events Lee has faced, he has remained as Malaysia’s favorite as he was nominated last week for the country’s 2014 sportsman of the year award.",

        "content": "Hoping to save another addict’s life, a U.S. family penned a brutally honest obituary for their 24 year old daughter who died of a heroin overdose.\nMolly Parks was found dead last week in Manchester, New Hampshire. Coming to terms with her death, Parks’ family wrote the obit hoping to inspire other addicts to seek help.\nHowever, this attracted worldwide attention for it’s brutal honesty.\nIn a painfully honest obituary Tom Parks outlined the details of how his daughter Molly Alice lost her fight against heroin addiction on April 16. “She tried to fight addiction in her own way,” wrote her father Tom Parks on Facebook, adding however that his daughter’s “fight came to an end in a bathroom of a restaurant with a needle of heroin.”\nHe also pleaded with others in similar situations to reach out. “If you have a friend or a relative who is fighting the fight against addiction please do everything you can to be supportive,” he wrote on Facebook.\nBelow is the obit, circulated several times on social media,\nOLD ORCHARD BEACH – Molly Alice Parks, age 24, who most currently resided in Manchester, NH, passed away in Manchester on April 16, 2015 as the result of a heroin overdose.\nShe was born in York, Maine on March 13, 1991, a daughter of Tom and Patti (Michaud) Parks.\nMolly graduated from Old Orchard Beach High School in 2009 and attended one year at SMCC until her addiction took over. Most recently, she was employed as a delivery driver for Portland Pie Co. in Manchester, NH. She enjoyed theater, fashion, reading – especially Harry Potter, and will always be remembered for fearless personality and her trademark red lipstick. Along Molly’s journey through life, she made a lot of bad decisions including experimenting with drugs. She fought her addiction to heroin for at least five years and had experienced a near fatal overdose before. Molly’s family truly loved her and tried to be as supportive as possible as she struggled with the heroin epidemic that has been so destructive to individuals and families in her age bracket.\nShe is survived by her parents- Tom Parks and his wife Pat Noble of Saco and Patti Michaud Parks of Berlin, NH; sister- Kasey Parks of OOB; step siblings- Dustin and Delayna Denicourt of Biddeford; maternal grandparents- Rita and Raymond Michaud of Berlin, NH; paternal grandmother- Ruth Parks of OOB; and numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, and a niece.\nIf you have any loved one’s who are fighting addiction, Molly’s family asks that you do everything possible to be supportive, and guide them to rehabilitation before it is too late.\nVisitation will be held on Wednesday, April 22, from 4-8 PM at the Old Orchard Beach Funeral Home, 36 Portland Ave., Old Orchard Beach, ME 04064\n \nPicture: Facebook",

        "content": "The earthquake that devastated Nepal and left thousands of people dead shifted the earth beneath Kathmandu by up to several meters south, but the height of Mount Everest likely stayed the same, experts said Tuesday.\nThe massive 7.8-magnitude quake on Saturday was the Himalayan nation’s deadliest disaster in more than 80 years, killing more than 4,300 people and causing massive destruction.\nAccording to early seismological data obtained from sound waves which travel through Earth after an earthquake, the ground beneath the capital Kathmandu may have moved about three metres (10 feet) southward, said University of Cambridge tectonics expert James Jackson.\nHis analysis was similar to that of Sandy Steacy, head of the physical sciences department at the University of Adelaide.\n“It’s likely that the earthquake occurred on the Himalayan Thrust fault, a plate boundary that separates the northern moving Indian sub-continent from Eurasia,” said Steacy.\n“The fault dips about 10 degrees to the north-northeast. The relative movement across the fault zone was on the order of three metres at its greatest, just north of Kathmandu.”\nThe fault lies between two tectonic plates — one bearing India pushing northward into a plate carrying Europe and Asia at a rate of about two centimetres (0.8 inches) per year — the process that created the Himalayas in the first place.\nMark Allen, from the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Durham in Britain, explained that the rocks on top of the fault moved southwards over the rocks underneath it, causing an overall shortening of the Earth’s crust in the region.\n“It would be simplistic to say that Kathmandu was relocated by three metres,” he said.\n“There may have been three metres of slip on the fault at the earthquake nucleation point at 15 kilometres depth. But this dies out in all directions, including upwards to the surface.”\nIt remains unclear whether the shifts may be large enough to necessitate adjustments to high-precision world maps.\nWhile Kathmandu moved, it is unlikely that the height of Mount Everest — the highest peak in the world — changed more than a few millimetres, with the mountain not directly above the faultline.\n“The main slip was west of Everest, the mountain was not directly above the fault plane,” said Steacy.\n“In addition, the dip of the fault is very shallow so three metres in a horizontal direction doesn’t mean much vertically.”\nAllen concurred, adding that “there may be an effect if an avalanche has dislodged some of the snow cover on the summit”.\nIan Main, a professor of seismology and rock physics at the University of Edinburgh, said there may have been a small change in height but it was too soon to tell.\n“We will know soon if any detectable height change has occurred, when those working on satellite-based ‘synthetic aperture radar’ look at the difference in snapshots of the ground surface position before and after the event,” he said.\nEverest stands at 8,848 metres (29,029 feet) above sea level, with Saturday’s quake triggering an avalanche on the mountain that killed at least 18 people at base camp.\nExperts warned that more aftershocks were likely, possibly for months to come.\n“The slip on the April 25th earthquake will have increased the stress on other segments of the same fault, or of adjacent faults, such that they are more likely to rupture themselves,” said Allen.\n“There may be earthquakes for months in the region, which likely relate to the main event.”\nSource: NDTV",

He further added that the PM has no idea about the effects this Constitution would have on the country and this is why the shortcomings of this Constitution needs to be addressed and presented to the people in a positive way.\nVenerable Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera noted that these amendments were presented in such a way that media is controlled in a dictatorial manner and that some of these proposals were removed due to the pressure exerted by the opposition. He further noted that President Maithripala Sirisena has created an opinion that it was Ranil Wickremesinghe who removed this clause included by those who wanted to suppress the media; that thePM and his followers came with a knife to stab but since the knife was taken away and thrown, the current situation had to be accepted.\nFormer Minister of Tourism,Nandana Gunathilaka noted that the Bribery Commission was given more powers through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. He further noted that within this legal system, there is no belief that the law will be tightly enforced against the stealing of public property. He further added that the death penalty can be imposed on those who are guilty of drug trafficking and that there is a need for a stronger legal system. He further stated that, as a political force,the country reached a juncture – to adhere to a new mixed electoral system.\nMinister of Power and Energy, Palitha Range Bandara stated that many who contested for the presidency said that they would change\nJ. R’s Constitution of 1978 within twenty four hours of being elected and that it was said they would abolish the Executive Presidency. However, he added that all those who said so continued to stay on in office for two terms; and the last president, Mahinda Rajapaksa did not stop at two. He added that this was the reason that the former president brought in the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. He also added that President Maithripala had stated he would work towards reducing the powers of the executive presidency – and he fulfilled this task with only one vote against the change in constitution.\nConvener of the National Movement for a Just Society, Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera noted that it was the Executive President himself who worked most to abolish the Executive Presidency and that there is one more victory to achieve  – that is the change of electoral system through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.",

Can we get some love for our #firstTweet?\n— GooglePlus (@GooglePlus) May 1, 2015\n\nIt’s peculiar timing on Google Plus’s part, not just because Google Plus launched in June 2011 but also because Google said in March it would dismantle the service into two separate products: streams and photos.\nNews of the Google Plus split wasn’t a surprise to many who used it and those who followed it. Since it debuted, the service never gained the same traction Facebook or Twitter did.\nLast October, Google claimed the social network had 300 million monthly active users, but an April report from digital marketing agency Stone Temple Consulting indicates there are potentially far fewer people who regularly putz around Google Plus, just 111 million, in fact. Put alongside Facebook’s 1.44 billion-strong user base and even Twitter’s 302 million, that’s a drop in the bucket.\nSo why tweet now?

He further added that those people who argue that the stability of a future government must be protected by introducing a system which will ensure that a party which gets past 50 percent of the vote, should have a stable government.\nHowever he went on to add that this alone should not be the criteria and that in his opinion, stability should be by ensuring and accommodating minorities. He further noted that if minority interests and minority political opinions is not accommodated within the chamber of the house that in itself can destabilise the government and the country.\nMinister of Resettlement, D.M. Swaminathan stated that the most fundamental issue is that the President of this country, who has been given the powers that has been vested in the 1978 constitution has come forward and democratically told the country, that he doesn’t want these powers and that he wants powers to democratically run this country.\nHe went on to add that the president is looking to run the country according to a democratic system involving the Prime Minister and the cabinet and the opposition’s efforts to not accept this only questions the same democratic powers that is being asked for.",

        "content": "The 38th Annual Convention of the Capital Maharaja Organisation was held at the Stein Studios in Ratmalana  recently under the auspices of President Maithripala Sirisena.\nAmong other notable guests who attended this year’s Annual Convention were the executives of the Capital Maharaja Organisation, the Maha Sangha, experts from various fields, and politicians.\nThe highlight of the event was the selection of the Executive of the Year where five executives of the Capital Maharaja Group were nominated for the coveted award. it was Chandana Sooriyabandara, the Channel Head of Sirasa TV who bagged the coveted Executive of the Year Award for 2014 – 2015.\nHere is a look at the full speech that was delivered during the annual convention on behalf of the Chairman of the Capital Maharaja Oraganisation,\n \nCHAIRMAN’S SPEECH 2014/2015\nGood evening Ladies & Gentlemen.\nAs I was writing this speech, I thought that 38 years is an incredibly long time for any convention to be held continuously, year after year, or for that matter, for someone to be working in the same organization, for that length of time.  In fact, my career spans an even longer period than that. What may be more interesting is that I have worked longer in this Institution, than the Founders, my Father and his friend, Mr. Mahadevan, did, and even longer than my brother, who is here with us today, who started before me but retired 15 years ago. Time really does fly.\n[quote]There are over eleven hundred executives, and only the very best find themselves on the short list, and finally the best among the best gets the gold.[/quote]\nIn 1977 when the first EOTY was held in our Office Board Room at Bankshall Street, the numbers of Executives were few, there was no short list and the selection was easy.  Today, it is much harder than it was then.  There are over eleven hundred executives, and only the very best find themselves on the short list, and finally the best among the best gets the gold.\nIn comparison, just imagine what it takes, for one person, out of a population of 21 million, to be elected as The President, and that too up against a strong competitor.  A tough task, but it was done by someone, who is humble and unassuming, who took up the challenge and won.\nMr. President. Welcome to our Annual Convention. You deserve a big hand for the courage you displayed in coming forward, as the common candidate, against all odds, and for getting the 19th Amendment implemented with an overwhelming majority in Parliament.\nYou had the courage to be different, which incidentally, Sir, is the motto of our Group.\nThe defining moment of the dramatic result of our last Presidential election is, to my mind, an event that has as much significance for Sri Lanka and its people, as the end of the civil war.\n[quote]we have been very active in this country’s commercial development for the last 85 years, since our inception and, we will continue to lead in all fields.[/quote]\nYour Excellency, I hope you will agree with me that your victory, while it is a validation of your beliefs and values, is also a triumph of the will of the people, to make our country Sri Lanka a more democratic, equitable and, progressive one and a country that is more than ready to participate fully, in the comity of nations.\nAs for our Group, we have been very active in this country’s commercial development for the last 85 years, since our inception and, we will continue to lead in all fields. Additionally, we have provided opportunities to many, who are today highly sought after professionals in the media field.\n[quote]We believe that our Media has played a significant role in setting standards in the electronic media culture, whether it be in entertainment, news or politics.  [/quote]\nOn the entertainment side, we have unearthed the hidden skills and talents of young men and women in our country through our Educational, General Entertainment and Reality programmes.  In News, we have not only been forthright and fearless, but also balanced and most of all sincere in our reporting.\nToday, we play the role of watchdog, which is frowned upon by a few, but acknowledged and appreciated by many, especially our loyal listeners and viewers, who are in the millions locally and internationally.\nBesides Media, we have maintained our emphasis on manufacturing and distribution, which is the foundation on which our Group has been built. We will take advantage of the forward thinking policies of the new government and, in the coming years invest further in expanding our Industrial operations.\nWe are therefore, in an unique position. On the one hand, to report on how the economy is moving, through our effective media and, on the other, play a major role in driving the economy through our multifaceted and diverse manufacturing, trading, distribution and export base. Setting an example for the rest.\n[quote]Today, we play the role of watchdog, which is frowned upon by a few, but acknowledged and appreciated by many, especially our loyal listeners and viewers, who are in the millions locally and internationally. [/quote]\nAs the EOTY progresses today, you will learn more about our performance during the last financial year and, our plans for the future. Sashi, who was appointed joint Managing Director in November 2014, will elaborate on this during his presentation.\nThe new generation, both Pradeep and Sashi, will continue to take on additional responsibilities and, with the CEO of the Group and the Group Directors, take our Group to the next level.  In this connection, I would like to mention that they have already signed up an agreement with Kansai of Japan for the manufacture of Paints.  Mr. Bharuka, the Managing Director and Mr. Jain, a Director of Kansai NerolacIndia, who are present with us today, will speak about our joint venture later on this evening.\nIn life you can look at others and ask HOW, Or question yourself, and say WHY NOT. 85 years ago, our founders, two friends from the Rural North, were ambitious, dreamed big and, asked themselves, WHY NOT.  They came to Colombo and realized their Dream.\n[quote]we have always had the spirit and resilience, to convert our dreams into reality.[/quote]\nMy brother & I also, had OUR dreams.\nWe expanded into Foods – Anchor was born.\nWe dreamed of providing mobile telephony – Dialog was born.\nOur dream to enter the Media, blossomed into MTV & MBC.\nStein Studios is the realization of, yet another dream.\nMost of all we kept our dreams intact, by not only surviving but also  being successful in the corporate world.\n[quote]Therefore, let us continue to dream the impossible, and together achieve what others cannot even imagine. [/quote]\nWe at Maharajas are compulsive dreamers and so, we continue to dream, because we have always had the spirit and resilience, to convert our dreams into reality.\nI am certain that those of you here, who are in your 20s & 30s and, even your 40s, are already dreaming big, which will result in taking our Group to even greater heights. It is my firm belief that, only in our Group do you have the opportunity and encouragement to realise your Dreams.\nPeople like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Richard Branson and Ted Turner decided to chase their dreams and breaking away from convention, gave the world Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Virgin and CNN. They made it happen. Today,  those Companies, are at the forefront of the international Corporate World touching every human-being on the planet.\nTherefore, let us continue to dream the impossible, and together achieve what others cannot even imagine.\nAs I said last year, speaking from my heart to all of you, our Executives, we have reached where we have, the hard way.  We have to move ahead and remove any obstacles that may come between us and our dreams.  Believe in this truth.  This is our strength.  That is why we stand tall among the Sri Lankan corporates. Our leadership position must never be challenged.\nNothing will or can stop us, as we have the best human capital that can be found in the mercantile sector.\nWE ARE THE MAHARAJAS\nI leave you with a quote from Walt Disney:\n“  All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them “\n-Walt Disney, 1901-1966\nGod Bless.",

It has now been fenced off with an orange barricade, the city said.\n“We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is,” said park representative Kyoko Tsujimura, adding that radiation elsewhere in the park remained low.\nOn Friday, television broadcast images of regulatory officials in work uniforms measuring radiation from a patch of dirt beside a colorful slide in the park.\nThe city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents.\nThousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home to hot zones closest to Tokyo Electric Power’s nuclear plant.\nIn the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks.\nA drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s office building this week.\nSource: Reuters",

The device was made public in an announcement in Japanese but there is neither an international launch date nor an accompanying ‘Compact’ version.\nThe Xperia Z4 is much like its Z3 predecessor, with the same 5.2-inch screen, a thinner 6.9mm form, and a Snapdragon 810 processor which clocks a more modest 2GHz but is eight-core and 64-bit. The rear-facing camera has the same eye-popping 20.7-megapixels, the front-facing camera has gotten a wide-angle lens, and elsewhere there’s 3GB of RAM under the hood and Android 5.0 Lollipop runs out of the box.\nSony is known for its water- and dust-resistant devices, and the Xperia Z4 also delivers on that front which is a controversial fact since the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge doesn’t contain these features\nSony had been rumoured to be considering an exit from the smartphone space, though its latest restructuring didn’t see that eventuality realized it remains a possibility in the future. The Xperia Z4 is another iterative product and, while the Xperia Z3 received positive reviews, it didn’t sell particularly well, which makes it hard to see how sticking to the same recipe will dig the company out of its rut on mobile.\nBut, if you’re an Xperia fan, stay tuned for details of the Z4’s international launch, which will come sooner rather than later now that the cat is out of the bag in Japan.\nSource: Techcrunch",

Unlike the first study, gender did not moderate these associations.\nSteers said that people afflicted with emotional difficulties may be particularly susceptible to depressive symptoms due to Facebook social comparison after spending more time on medium.\nFor already distressed individuals, this distorted view of their friends’ lives may make them feel alone in internal struggles, which may compound their feelings of loneliness and isolation.",

Repeated calls on that number later went unanswered.\nThe claim follows a similar account offered by the headman of a small village in Tamil Nadu who said some of the victims were headed to Tirupati in search of jobs when they were pulled off the bus by policemen from Andhra Pradesh.\nThe shooting of the 20 men has provoked furious protests from human rights activists and a demand from Tamil Nadu for an independent inquiry. The Centre, too, has sought a report from the Andhra Pradesh government over the incident.\nSome of the bodies have burn marks; others show bullet injuries in the chest and head, challenging the police claim that they opened fire in self-defence.\nA police task force said that early on Tuesday morning, it was attacked with knives and axes in the Chittoor forests in the biggest operation in recent years to catch illegal sandalwood traders.\nTop officers have so far not divulged how many policemen and forest officials were involved in the encounter. Activists allege that the fact that none were injured suggests that the police was not ambushed.\nLogs of the rare red sandalwood or red sanders that the police claim to have collected from the victims have government markings, according to Congress leader Chintah Mohan.\nThis, he said, proves that wood had not been illicitly felled. “This area doesn’t even have red sanders trees,” Mr Mohan said.\nSource: NDTV",

But please know this: we will never forget you”\nShe went onto note ” Like you, I was a target of militants who did not want girls to go to school. Gunmen shot me and two of my friends on a school bus. All three of us survived and are back in school. Now we speak out on behalf of all girls about the right to get a proper education. Our campaign will continue until you and all girls and boys around the world are able to access a free, safe and quality secondary education.”\n“I look forward to the day I can hug each one of you, pray with you, and celebrate your freedom with your families,” Ms Yousafzai said.\nMalala’s letter, which she said was “a message of solidarity love and hope”, comes as events, including marches, prayers and vigils, were being held to mark the girls’ 12 months in captivity.",

The main tradition of this ceremony is to appreciate  the Sun God who provides the rich resources of rice and other food items.\nThe Sinhala and Tamil New Year New Year will dawn at 1. 47 on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe inauspicious time or Nonagathaya will take place from  7.23 Tuesday morning to 08.11.\nAstrologers state that it is wise to take the first meal at 7.23 a.m. and stop working in order to take part in religious activities.\nThe auspicious time to kindle the hearth is at 2.05 p.m.\nIt has been deemed auspicious to dress in red attire, turn eastwards and kindle the hearth to prepare red milk rice mixed with cane sugar, accompanied by a sweet meat.\nIt has also been deemed auspicious to conduct transactions at 02.42 p.m., Tuesday, April 14.  This is also the auspicious time to consume food, facing the East and in red attire.\nThe auspicious time for the anointing of the head with oils, is 09.06 a.m. on Wednesday, April 15; while the auspicious colour for attire is light green and the auspicious direction, North.\nAccording to Mahinda Kumara Dalupotha however, there is an issue as to how people can comply with age-old traditions but they cannot be followed. The water that comes through the pipes can be stopped before the inauspicious time. After the Nonagathaya, you can have a small clay pot and place a white cloth under it and collect the water from the tap or the pipe. Subsequently, based on the religious following , you cannot engage in religious activities. If you are a Buddhist you can visit the temple and pour the water to the Bo tree. If you are a Hindu, you can also visit the Kovil and do the same. The clay pot that was used to mark the end of the old year can be cleaned with clay and used once again to welcome the New Year with new intentions.\nDeputy General Manager of the Sri Lanka Transport Board, Raja Gunatilleke says that buses will be dispatched from the Pettah Central Bus Stand based on the requirement during the festive season.\nWhen News 1st visited the Private Bus Stand in Bastian Mawatha , it was evident that facilities had been provided in a manner where there will be no congestion to the passengers travelling in buses.

The $14.3m (£9.5m) prize was never claimed.

It is also constantly monitored by a video camera.\nIt is alleged Mr Tipton used his position as Security Director to change the video camera settings and record only one second in every minute. This would have given him enough time to enter the room and plug a thumb drive into the computer.\nOn that drive, according to the prosecution, was a rootkit: a stealthy computer program designed to do a specific task and, in this case, then erase itself.\nThat task was to predetermine the winning lottery numbers for the draw that Mr Tipton was to later buy the winning ticket",

        "content": "Children being used for begging by women has become a common occurrence during the festive season.\nAs suspicion has arisen over the manner in which these women behave with children, News1st launched investigations into these happenings – children being carried around by women, who, at most times are not their mothers.\nYou may have encountered several instances in which men and women with children were seen scavenging the busy streets of Colombo. Are they using these children as tools for begging for an actual cause, or has this now become a business? News1st inspected several streets of the city of Colombo in search of beggars with children by their side.\nWhat we observed was that  children in the hands of these beggars seemed to be in a trance.Thus doubts arise whether these children are in their senses or whether they have been drugged.\nNews1st inquired from a woman opposite the Fort Railway Station about the child who was with her. Her response was one of anger, aggressiveness and tension rather than one that provoked sympathy and kindness.\nWe immediately contacted the emergency hotline of the National Child Protection Authority to inform them of this beggar. The individual on the phone said that the Pettah Police Division would be informed of the matter immediately.\nNews1st informed the NCPA of this beggar with the child at 12.36 p.m. Twenty minutes later at 12.56, there was still no official arriving at the location and the   woman had already left the area with the child.\nStill on location, we contacted the Child Protection Authority once again, as no official arrived even by then. The News1st journalist Lakmal Kirindigala identified himself to the NCPA – that he is from News1st – and asked at what time the NCPA informed the police of the incident. The NCPA said that the police unit of the NCPA were informed within five minutes.\nMeanwhile, we came across another beggar with a child telling passers-by that they are in need of money for treatment for an illness of the child.\nHowever, when our team inspected the documents and subsequently questioned the woman about it, she said that the treatment is being provided for free and they are compelled to beg for money as her husband had abandoned them and that she has two children who have to go to school.\nWhile News1st made inquiries from the Ministry of Children’s Affairs. We were told by a senior official at the Ministry that as the State Minister is abroad, immediate steps would be taken upon her arrival.\n\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n\n\n\nNews1st takes a closer look at beggars and ‘their children’Read More: http://wp.me/p5qlpD-nsu\nPosted by Newsfirst.lk on Friday, April 17, 2015",

        "content": "Dean Jones has made an out-of-the-box “two-coach” proposal to India’s cricket bosses who sit down later this month to choose Duncan Fletcher’s replacement.\nThe Zimbabwean, who replaced Gary Kirsten after the 2011 World Cup, ended his tumultuous assignment with BCCI after India bowed out in the semifinals of the World Cup Down Under.\nJones pointed out India have some great options in Sourav Ganguly (for shorter formats like T20s and ODIs) and Rahul Dravid (Tests). The Aussie said Ravi Shastri should be appointed as the high-performance manager, who will oversee everything.\nIndia’s tryst with foreign coaches has been mixed. Generally, low-profile men have done well in a team where players, across generations, are high on ego. Personality clashes are therefore not uncommon.\nFletcher was a great survivor. After India lost eight Test matches overseas, experts like Sunil Gavaskar wanted the former England coach sacked. But Fletcher completed his full tenure largely due to the support he got from captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.\nFletcher managed to retain his job after India’s horrible show in England last year. Ravi Shastri’s appointment as Team Director somewhat clipped Fletcher’s wings. The decision to appoint Shastri was reportedly taken without keeping Dhoni in the loop. The captain was merely conveyed the BCCI decision over a late-night call.\nJones suggests India should retain Shastri as a high-performance manager. Australia have a similar position under which a coach (Darren Lehman) works. Shastri was India’s director till the recently-concluded World Cup. The new BCCI management may not be willing to retain Shastri in this role and then have a Ganguly and Dravid under him. The equations just don’t work.\nGanguly and Dravid have their hands full with media assignments. Dravid, the Rajasthan Royals mentor, is happy doing short coaching stints and handle his media assignments at the same time. He can balance that much better and would not like to wear a cap of thorns. Invited by Fletcher, he had a short stint with Team India at the start of the England series.\nGanguly is keen to seek a future in cricket administration. He is the joint secretary of the Cricket Association of Bengal and hosts a popular reality show on TV. Ganguly remains one of the most sought after TV experts. And Ganguly will certainly not work under Shastri. At best, short assignments as team director may suit him.\nJones’ Australian model sounds nice. “India have enough coaches. No need for a foreigner. Two coaches under Ravi will be great. There is way too much cricket and players hate to see the same face every time,” professed Jones.\nIndia already have two captains – Dhoni for shorter formats and Virat Kohli for Tests. The two-coaches theory looks good on paper but it is impossible to see Shastri, Ganguly, Dravid and Anil Kumble (Jones mentioned him too) working together as coaches.\nSource: NDTV",

Users have to have the latest version of the Google app (aka Google Search app) installed on their smartphone for the ‘find my phone’ command to work.\n“If the pesky phone is hiding nearby, Google can ring it for you – or you can see it on the map if you, say, forgot it at the bar. Just make sure you’ve got the latest version of the Google app!” says the post.\nAn option to ring the smartphone will also be shown, clicking on which will ring the smartphone on full volume for five minutes. Users can stop the ringing by pressing the handset’s power button. We tried both the ring and ‘find my phone’ features, and found the lost smartphone’s GPS also needs to be active, otherwise the new feature will not locate the handset.\nGoogle last month rolled out an update to Android Device Manager that was meant to help users find their lost device via an Android Wear device.\nThe feature can either work with voice command “Ok Google. Start. Find my phone” or by selecting the ‘Find my phone’ option from the start menu. If your device is mapped with Android Device Manager, it will start ringing at full volume till the time your Android Wear device/ smartwatch is in range (Bluetooth range).\nThe Android Device Manager was introduced in 2013 and essentially allowed locating, resetting and deleting data for Android devices from Web.\nSource: NDTV",

Incredibly, Galle Cricket Club recovered from the dismal first-innings total to win by four runs and save themselves from being relegated from Sri Lanka’s first class competition.\nSent in to bat by Sri Lanka Air Force Sports Club in a crucial match to decide which team would drop out of the Premier Championship at the weekend, Galle were toppled for 31 in 15.1 overs thanks largely to the bowling of Asiri Karunaratne, who claimed 5-21.\nIn a team boasting eight debutants, it was 16-year-old Navindu Nirmal who top-scored for Galle with seven. Air Force then scored 215 to lead by 184 with a comfortable victory in sight, but there was where the game turned.\nGalle cruised past 184 for the loss of just two wickets, scoring 295 courtesy of a century from former Sri Lanka U-19 Charith Asalanka to set the Air Force team 112 to win. The task proved too much and Air Force were bowled out for 107, handing Galle the unlikeliest of four-run victories.\nIt was the lowest winning first-innings score in a first-class match since 1924, when Gloucestershire were dismissed for 31 against Middlesex.

In the directive issued on March 20 this year, the SEC noted that Kalpitiya Beach Resort PLC had raised 283.5 million rupees from the public in November 2011, with the funds intended to finance the construction of Citrus Kalpitiya as stated in the prospectus. The directive, was triggered by what was termed by the SEC as an “inordinate delay” in the construction of the hotel.\nThe SEC points out that in a previous disclosure, the company had also stated the construction of the resort would commence from December 2011, with commercial operations commencing in early 2015. The directive from the SEC expressed “grave concern” over the company’s failure to complete construction within the time-frame specified in its prospectus. The SEC directed the company to pass a resolution specifying an alternative course of action with regard to funds collected through the IPO on or before the 10th of May 2015.\nIt is against this backdrop that the Company issued notice yesterday of an EGM to be held on  May 8, 2015.\nIn the proposed resolution, the shareholders could agree to consider courses of action including –\n1. Await the new government’s vision and intent to implement the development plans for Kalpitiya with clear time lines so that the company may review the appropriate time to commence the project.\n2. Continue to explore possible investor interest that would negate externalities, so that the company would not be dependent on Kalpitiya destination development as promised in the past by the government.\n3. Consider partners who would create unique marketable products that will further ensure occupancy as a standalone hotel such as a golf course and theme parks.\n4. To explore the feasibility of an alternative location, within Sri Lanka and the Maldives as an alternate destination to Kalpitiya for a tourism project.\nA google search for Kalpitiya Beach Resort PLC, would lead you to the website of Citrus Leisure, also a public quoted company. Under the hotels tab, you would find links to Citrus Hikkaduwa and Citrus Waskaduwa, the other two hotels operated by the company, while there is also a non functional link to Citrus Kalpitiya.\nData for Kalpitiya Beach Resort PLC on the website of the Colombo Stock Exchange shows that while the stock price reached an all time high of 24 rupees, at the close of trading today, the stock price was Rs.3  and 90 cents.\nIn spite of the fact that the SEC notes in its letter that construction was to begin in December 2011, three and a half years later, the satellite image of the area from Google Earth, shows the current state of the property.\nOur reporter confirmed that no construction has taken place at the said location.\nInvestigative Business Journalist Faraz Shauketaly noted that 283 million rupees were raised in 2011 at the time of the IPO which was money that came from small time retail investors resulting in the share price to reach its peak of 24 rupees. Four years later, the company now announces that they plan to look for new investors and or a new location, maybe in the Maldives. This is not what the investors paid for, they invested their money for a project in Kalpitiya. They are now faced with a scenario where the share price is worth only 3 rupees 90. It is now upto the SEC led by Mr. Karunaratne to ensure that the officers of this company are held accountable fully and that the small time investors are taken care of.\nWhen News 1st contacted Prema Cooray, the Chairman of Citrus Leisure PLC, he noted that the Board of Directors had deferred its decision on the Citrus Kalpitiya Project, as Kalpitiya is yet to be developed as a tourist destination.",

The hotels are all full including the quaint English style lodges and anyone with a spare room to let.\nThe city was founded by Sir Samuel Baker, the discoverer of Lake Albert the explorer of the Nile in 1846. Nuwara Eliya’s climate lent itself to becoming the prime sanctuary of the British civil servants and planters in Ceylon back in the magnificent colonial era where Ceylon was the toast of Asia.\nNuwara Eliya or ‘Little England’ then was a country retreat where the British could immerse themselves in their pastimes like fox hunting, deer hunting, elephant hunting, polo, golf and cricket. Although the town was founded in the 19th century by the British, the whole district is today visited by local travelers, specially during April, the season of flowers, pony races, go cart races and the auto rally.\nMany of the buildings retain features from the colonial period such as the Queen’s Cottage, General’s House, Grand Hotel, Hill Club, Town Post Office and even new hotels are often built and furnished in the colonial style. His Worship the present Mayor, Mr. D.G. Mahinda Kumara the youngest elected mayor told us building regulations will be strictly adhered to and the old world charm protected. Not only a politician but also a knowledgeable, experienced hotelier, and an eco-tourism promoter Mr. Mahinda has lots of ideas to make the city a protected and leading travel destination in the country and hopes to have the full co operation of the government and supportive departments assist him achieve this through funding and planned eco organizing in this fertile region.\n[image_sliders]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5.jpg”] [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[/image_sliders]\n“GO OUTDOORS”\nI was much honored to meet the mayor at his picturesque hotel ‘The Alpine’ across the racetrack when the organizers of “GO OUTDOORS” the pioneering and innovative motorhome, caravan, camper trailer and camping    gear outfit invited us to inspect their gear by the scenic shores of Lake Gregory.  Tapping into the travelling DNA of all Sri Lankans these young gentlemen led by  Mr. Hemaka de Alwis is planning to implement the provisioning of safe,  environmentally friendly, caravan and camping sites in key points around the  island.\nPointing out that families who travelled together in caravans are interact  with  nature unlike whilst staying in a hotel improving social interactions since kids  will  more often stay off the phones and a healthy appreciation for the environment  is  developed.\nThe travelling motorhome or caravan is a popular mobile alternative  for  families and friends choosing more independence in the very fast evolving  tourism  sector of post war, safe to travel environmentally diverse Sri Lanka.\n[image_sliders]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Go-outdoors-board-.jpg”]\n[/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/31.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/51.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/41.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/31.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/22.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/11.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[/image_sliders]\nThe Grand Hotel\nTo touch on more ancient history relevant to this region the ‘Ramayana’ the Indian mythical epic tells us how Ravana the King of Lanka robbed Rama of his wife Sita, who he was smitten by and brought her back to Lanka. The people of Sri Lanka believe that Ravana had his capital in Nuwara-Eliya or the “City by the glade”. He is believed to have kept Sita captive in ‘Sita Eliya’. Today a Hindu temple is situated in  the same location and the famous and very beautiful Haggala Botanical Gardens is very close by. The story tells that the  monkey army of Rama came to save Sita. Ravana punished  Hanuman the leader of the monkey force by setting fire to his  tail. It is then said that Hanuman burnt all of Nuwara-Eliya with his burning tail. Legend has it that the black fertile soil, which forms the top layer here, consists of the ashes of the city of Ravana burnt to the ground by Hanuman.\nThe modern history of Nuwara-Eliya begins in 1818 when the British Surgeon Dr.John Davy relating thus said, “I was walking in the middle of a forest and I saw beautiful white shining, diamond shaped waterfalls. I came to the top of a mountain and the people who came with me said that it is the highest land of this country” Dr.John Davy goes on to say that Nuwara Eliya has many trees, elephants, wild animals  and Gemstones. Legend has it that the elephants were hunted for  sport in such huge numbers that the mausoleums of these  famous hunters are hit by lightening annually for the sin  committed by evidence of some of the cracked graves stones split  open by lighting.\nSir Edward Barnes the Governor of Ceylon from 1824-1831 constructed modern roads into Nuwara-Eliya and built his holiday home spending a princely 8000 Pounds at the time. He named it “Barnes Hall” and today it is known as the very luxurious ‘Grand Hotel’ with a 154 rooms, coffee shop with Thai and Indian dining.\n[image_sliders]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/grand.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/23.jpg”] [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/12.jpg”] [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/32.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/52.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/71.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/8.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[/image_sliders]\nJetwing St.Andrews \nThe history of the St Andrews Hotel not far away, is as interesting as it follows the history of true pioneering hotelier families to date, in succession, beginning in 1875. Known as the ‘Scots club’ and the proximity to the golf course may account for the naming of the club as the St Andrews. In 1918 the now ‘hotel’ was bought by a syndicate headed by Mr. Arthur Ephraums to include the two story wing in the west and behind the main block a large dining room, kitchen and servants quarters together with a bar and billiards rooms. In 1919 the now refurbished hotel opened for business with a young cousin of the owners a Mr. De Zilwa as manager.\nThe depression years of the 1925 to 1932 affected the hotel adversely and it was closed  with an appointed caretaker. In 1933 Julius & Creasy held the mortgage and the hotel was offered to Mr. and Mrs. De Zilwa. Excerpts of this early saga can be read in the interesting writings of Mr. David De Zilwa and Percy De Zilwa in much detail. The De Zilwa’s went on to create a very successful hotel occupancy in the 1930’s with all guests on an all inclusive rate with a ‘full on’ menu and by the 1950’s an attractive bed and breakfast tariff were bringing in more and more clients to the hotel. The ‘Zilwan Jazz band’ comprised of the De Zilwa family was in great demand and many a celebrity is know to have stayed at the hotel. The startling political changes of post independence era saw the Tamil laborers originally recruited from India by the British, stateless. Their applications for citizenship were too numerous for the local ‘Kachcheri’ or government office so the government took over 16 rooms and more space at the hotel to attend to applications. It was said that the estate families became citizens of Ceylon at the St Andrews. The 1970’s saw a period of change for the De Zilwa family with the elderly De Zilwa’s deciding to follow their children to Australia as soon as buyer for the hotel could be found and in 1976 a buyer was found – Mr. ‘Gem’ Milhuisen a hotel owner and agent for Vingressor, a Swedish travel company to cater for tourists. During 1977 to 1978 St Andrews was substantially upgraded into its present form seen today. In 1986 ‘Gem’ Milhuisen went into partnership with Mr. Herbert Cooray also a hotel owner and director of the Jetwing group of hotels and St Andrews was added to the Jetwing group. The St Andrews today is a modern hotel in the hills with an average occupancy of 70% throughout the year with a 190-200USD average room rate.\n \n[image_sliders]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/St-Andrews-of-old.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/13.jpg”] [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/72.jpg”] [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/62.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/53.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/43.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/33.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[image_slider link=”full_url_link” source=”http://newsfirst.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/24.jpg”]  [/image_slider]\n[/image_sliders]\nNext week we will continue our walk through the hills to ‘Horton plains’ and the very edge of the precipice to ‘Worlds end’ and beyond.",

The recognition of the Right to Information as a Fundamental Right\n4. The establishment of a transparent and accepted procedure in the appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal\n5.

Without these independent institutions the constitution ceases to be a living document, becomes irrelevant to the people, and undermines democracy, which could lead, also to anarchy.\nSecretary of BASL Attorney at-Law Ajith Pathirana points out that the Executive Committee of the BASL discussed this matter, came to a decision and presented facts regarding the amendment to the constitution to the Supreme Court. The BASL has also presented these facts to the government regarding this matter.\nMeanwhile, Deputy President of BASL Attorney at-Law Saliya Pieris says that he believes they have received a golden opportunity, where the Parliament can safeguard the rule of law and table the required provisions to ensure the independence of the judiciary.\nHe went onto note that the Supreme Court has issued its determination regarding the existing provisions in the bill of the 19th Amendment to the constitution saying that there need not be a public referendum, instead it could be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament.\n \n \n\n// <![CDATA[\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n// ]]&gt;\n\n\nBASL convenes media briefing to elaborate stance on 19th AmendmentRead more : http://goo.gl/H2Dz3S\nPosted by Newsfirst.lk on Saturday, April 18, 2015",

They were also investigating if there was a second explosion after people rushed to the scene to help. Further the police noted a third blast that shook Jalalabad was a controlled detonation after experts discovered another bomb close to the scene of the first explosion.\nTaliban insurgents denied responsibility, although they have claimed earlier killings in a wave of attacks coinciding with the sharp drawdown of foreign troops. For the first time since the hardline Islamist Taliban movement was ousted from power in 2001, Afghan forces are fighting with little support from NATO troops.\nNATO, which at its peak had 130,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, has only a few thousand left, involved mainly in training and special operations.\nSource: Reuters",

If the CBSL Governor is not responsible for increasing the requirement to Rs. 10 Billion, then who at the Tender Board Committee should be held accountable?\n2. If it was not the Governor who informed Perpetual Treasuries of the increased requirement, then who was it?\nLeader  of the Democratic Left Front Vasudeva Nanayakkara says that he may not be solely responsible but he is responsible in principle, adding that he is the governor of the Central Bank and his son-in-law was with whom the loot has been shared.\nMeanwhile, Investigative Business Journalist Faraz Shauketaly notes that no governor is ever single-handedly responsible for anything at the Central Bank, and they really don’t need a committee to tell them that. He went onto say that Arjuna Mahendran as Governor has admitted to a failure and it is this failure that resulted in the interest rates going up, very unusually.\nSpeaking exclusively to News1st on  March 16, CBSL Governor Arjuna Mahendran said that he takes responsibility for not informing primary dealers regarding the increased requirement.",

        "heading": "Cricket World Cup: Test Match Special team of the tournament",
        "content": "Australia will meet New Zealand in the World Cup final on Sunday to complete a tournament littered with outstanding individual performances. In advance of the showpiece, the Test Match Special experts got their heads together to pick their team of the tournament.\nThe selectors comprised chairman Jonathan Agnew, Michael Vaughan, Vic Marks and Jim Maxwell. And although there were three Englishmen on the panel, unsurprisingly not a single England player made their team.\n1) Brendon McCullum (New Zealand, captain)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRuns: 328, Average: 41.00, Strike Rate: 191.81\nExplosive. It’s a powerful word, but one that still doesn’t do full justice to the incredible impact of New Zealand’s captain at the top of the order. He mauled Steven Finn in the group phase, but it was his ruthless dismantling of South Africa pace man Dale Steyn in the semi-final that provided one of the tournament’s most electrifying episodes.\n2) Martin Guptill (New Zealand)\n\nRuns: 532, Average: 76.00, Strike Rate: 108.79\nOn the rare occasions when McCullum hasn’t fired, Guptill invariably has. He ended a patchy run of form with 105 in a tight run chase against Bangladesh, then shattered Chris Gayle’s record for the highest World Cup score with an astonishing 237 not out in the quarter-final victory over West Indies.\n3) Kumar Sangakkara (Sri Lanka, wicketkeeper)\n\nRuns: 541, Average: 108.20, Strike Rate 105.87\nHow do you replace the irreplaceable? Kumar Sangakkara bowed out of one-day cricket by becoming the first player to score hundreds in four successive World Cup matches. A master of making every ball count, his 117 not out against England was a study in controlled brutality.\n4) Steve Smith (Australia)\n\nRuns: 346, Average: 57.66, Strike Rate: 94.02\nUnorthodox, but incredibly effective, Steve Smith has continued his golden Australian summer by becoming the lynchpin of his team’s batting line-up at the World Cup. He was the first Australian to score a World Cup semi-final hundred and the second after David Boon to score at least 50 in four consecutive World Cup innings.\n5) AB de Villiers (South Africa)\n\nRuns: 482, Average: 96.40, Strike Rate: 144.31\nA force of nature. De Villiers lived up to his billing as the most destructive batsman in the game with the fastest 150 in one-day history from 64 deliveries against West Indies. He followed that with blistering fifties against Pakistan, the UAE and New Zealand and was the epitome of energy and athleticism in the field.\n6) Glenn Maxwell (Australia)\n\nRuns: 324, Average: 64.80, Strike Rate: 182.02, Wickets: 5, Average 36.20, Economy Rate: 5.83\nIf Kevin Pietersen is the kind of player who empties the bars, Glenn Maxwell can turn a grown man sober. His 102 off 53 balls against Sri Lanka was an annihilation, while his handy off-spin has allowed Australia to play without a front-line spinner. The ‘Big Show’ just got bigger.\n7) Corey Anderson (New Zealand)\n\nRuns: 231, Average: 38.50, Strike Rate: 109.47, Wickets: 14, Average: 16.21, Economy Rate: 6.45\nAn exceptional all-round performance from the 24-year-old New Zealander with arms like tree trucks. Whether he was snaffling crucial wickets with his brisk left-arm seam bowling or crashing lower-order runs, he contributed something in every match and scored a crucial 58 in their semi-final win over South Africa.\n8) Daniel Vettori (New Zealand)\n\nWickets: 15, Average: 18.80, Economy Rate: 3.98\nEven in his 20th year as a professional cricketer, Vettori remains a match-winner. He was the catalyst to Australia’s collapse in their riveting group game, by taking two crucial wickets in a miserly spell, and destroyed the part-timers of Afghanistan with extraordinary figures of 10-4-18-4. And rarely can a score of seven not out have been as telling as Vettori’s in the Kiwis’ semi-final run chase.\n9) Mitchell Starc (Australia)\n\nWickets: 20, Average: 10.20, Economy Rate 3.65\nA one-man wrecking ball, Mitchell Starc eclipsed his more celebrated team-mate Mitchell Johnson with devastating left-arm pace bowling at the beginning and end of every innings. He has taken at least two wickets in every match at a truly remarkable economy rate of 3.65 and will be hoping to repeat his six-wicket haul against New Zealand when the teams meet again on Sunday.\n10) Trent Boult (New Zealand)\n\nWickets: 21, Average: 15.76, Economy Rate: 4.41\nBoult has underlined his status as one of the most exciting young bowlers in international cricket by spearheading the New Zealand attack with aplomb. The left-arm quick has a tournament-leading 21 wickets and has bowled a staggering 14 maidens – twice as many as anyone else in the World Cup.\n11) Morne Morkel (South Africa)\n\nWickets: 17, Average: 17.58, Economy rate 4.38\nLike Starc, Morkel has outbowled an illustrious compatriot, taking six more wickets than Steyn in South Africa’s run to the semi-finals. A consistent menace, his tears at the conclusion of the Proteas’ agonising defeat by New Zealand told of a man who had left everything out on the field.\n12th man: Mohammed Shami (India)\n\nWickets: 17, Average: 17.29, Economy rate: 4.81\nThe standout performer in an India team that took all 10 wickets in every match until the semi-final. He claimed three or more wickets in four of his first six matches but came unstuck against Australia and was narrowly edged out by Morkel in the final XI.\nSource: BBC",

Ekanayake, Ranjith Zoysa and Chief Minister of the Western Province Prasanna Ranatunga and representatives from provincial councils and local government institutions were present for this rally.\nAlthough Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was not present, he had sent a message to the rally.\nSpeaking at the rally, UPFA Western Provincial Councillor, Udaya Gammanpila stated that 29 MPs of the Sri Lanka Freedom Alliance has cast aside the ban of the party and have risen on to this stage. They wish to see the party achieve victory. This not a task of four parties of the Alliance, but a task of a majority of the SLFP.\nChief Minister of the Western Province, Prasanna Ranatunga  expressed the following views:\nWe are not against President Maithripala Sirisena. At this historic meeting what we request from you is to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister of this country. In 1994 when Chandrika was against our Party Leader, the Late Sirimavo Bandaranaike ……. and when we brought in Chandrika to make the party victorious , the leadership was provided from Gampaha. However, what happened afterward? Chandrika won, all those leaders with Madame Sirimavo came to Madame Chandrika and told tales against the former and destroyed them. Today, some of those leaders who have banded with President Maithripala Sirisena are doing the same thing.\nUPFA MP, Bandula Gunawardena also shared his views:\nHe said that for the first time in the history of independent Sri Lanka, a Singapore National named Arjuna Mahendran has been appointed to the place where the money is. This Singapore national has come and dropped the country’s interest to its single digits. When the 100 days goes by, the interest rate is in two digits so that the benefits can be given to their relatives. The treasury bonds have incurred a loss in billions to the country.

In 2013-2014, 28 per cent of pregnant women who attended the NHS Blackpool smoked, while in central London only two per cent of expectant mothers smoked.\nResearch has found that pregnant mothers who smoke risk damaging their unborn children’s hearts and can also increase the risk of miscarriage and premature births.\nThe pilot study, conducted by Durham and Lancaster Universities, was published in the medical journal Acta Paediatrica.\n\n \n \n \nSource: independent.co.uk",

        "content": "The Dutch fort Galle.\nView of the Indian Ocean from the Galle Fort\nThis week I drove to Galle and not for the first time was blown away by the beauty and history of this fortified city and surroundings. The history of some its hotels and lodges are just as interesting as the history of this fortified seaside walled city built mostly by Colonials. I have taken some excerpts from the writings and descriptions of some authors who have like me found this city so fascinating.\nThe Dutch Fort in Galle close to the island’s southernmost point, 173km from Colombo, has the distinction of being the best-preserved sea fort in South Asia. A living heritage site, this 222-acre attraction is a superb blend of architecture, with fortifications that resemble those in the coastal areas of Portugal. The fall of Galle to the Dutch in 1640 saw its fortifications consolidated further along the lines of the fortified cities of Europe. The Dutch and the English colonial styles are evident in the deep verandahs of houses supported by timber or masonry pillars. Originally established by the Portuguese in the 16th Century, it reached its pinnacle under Dutch rule in the 18th Century, providing spacious housing, wide roads and all necessary facilities within its walls including an intricate sewage system that was ahead of its time. When it comes to fortified towns, nothing can compete with the Dutch Fort in Galle. This World Heritage Site on the south coast was the main port of call for ships sailing between the East and Europe.\nCourt of arms above an entry to the Fort\nThe original entrance gate to the Fort, on the northeast side of the peninsula still bears the carved insignia of the Dutch East Indies Company (or VOC, from “Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie”). The Fort also hosts some of the islands most exclusive boutique-style accommodation in former villas restored to their colonial glory.\nAgainst this background, a consortium of British businessmen in 1863 acquired the imposing three-storied former Dutch – and latterly British – garrison building standing at the junction of Church and Middle Streets with a commanding view of the harbor, and set up a European-style hostelry that, with a shrewd commercial eye of the taste of Western travellers for the romantically exotic, they christened it The Oriental Hotel. Thomas Munson (Tom) Barker, ably assisted by his wife, became The Oriental Hotel’s first live-in manager. Competition was tough – at this time a dozen or more first-class hotels in Galle Fort and nearby catered to weekly passenger ships and other trade. Clientele could be tough, too – very early in the new hotel’s history; a mob of English seamen from H.M.S. Bernice started a full-scale riot in the bar. The Galle native police were unable to cope, and called for a force of 20 European constables to be sent from Colombo as reinforcements.\nThe New Oriental Hotel before it evolved into the now popular Amangalle\nThis (garrison) fort was converted into the New Oriental Hotel in 1865. Initially, the complex of buildings formed the headquarters of the Dutch commanders and their staff. During British rule, the complex was used as the quarters for their soldiers. It is now a heritage hotel under the Aman Resorts group of international hotels and in 2005 named the Amangalla.\nBy the later 1890s however, despite its “worldwide reputation”, the Oriental Hotel had fallen on hard times financially. For whatever reason, the British owners could not make it profitable. Even in Galle’s heyday, many ocean passengers preferred to make the half-day trip by fast mail coach to Colombo, where there was more choice of accommodation. By the early 1880s, Galle’s boom days were over, thanks largely to the new breakwater and harbor in Colombo, far better suited to take large ships than the former’s exposed and hazardous inner harbor. The collapse of the coffee plantation industry in the mid-1880s through blight, coming at the same time as the shift to Colombo, also hit Galle hard. The arrival of the\nWalking down the streets of Galle Fort\nrailway in Galle in 1894 failed to halt the decline of the town as an entrepot. Many Burgher families migrated to the capital. In the late 1890s Bishop van Rhee of the Roman Catholic Church almost bought the Oriental Hotel for a new school to replace the St. Aloysius site in town, but his absence abroad at the crucial moment lost him the chance. Instead, the sale went in 1899 (registered as an agreement of sale in 1900) for a mere Rs. 40,000 to an extremely capable and shrewd local Burgher businessman named Albert Richard Ephraums (1846-1904). Thus began the remarkable connection between the soon-to-be-renamed New Oriental Hotel (NOH) and the Ephraums family of Galle, which would last unbroken for almost a century.\nA Dutch Burgher Lady takes a Sunday stroll pass the Church back in the day.\nOn May 7th 1995 the New Oriental Hotel Galle in the Fort provided the venue for the 90th birthday party thrown by Aman Resorts, leaser of the hotel for the next quarter century, for Nesta Brohier, holder of the Dutch Order of the Orange Nassau and a lady of whom it has been written that for half a lifetime as the “grand old lady of Galle Fort” she watched over “the flotsam that ceaselessly flowed into the hotel and out”, and that as “a woman of great physical attraction, she exuded charm”. Nesta had been born in the NOH, in Room 25, which was then part of the owner’s suite.\nA heady history indeed and those wanting to read more of this hotels history and the burgher families that shaped much of the towns history can read more in the interesting writings of Joe Simpson who has chronicled the centuries old little known saga in delightful detail.\nToday the Amangalle stands elegantly where the New Oriental stood as the most eye-catching hotel inside the Fort continuing the legacy of the formers tradition for superior accommodation and service of more than a century.\n\nThe Dutch Fort Hotel : A boutique hotel with an exquisite heritage\nInterior of the the Dutch Fort hotel\nWalking down past the beautiful Old Dutch Reformed Church built in 1755 next door to Amangalle and further down the street I came to the Dutch Fort Hotel. Managed by Mr. David Elgar an experienced hotelier and Australian, the Dutch Fort Hotel is a feast for the eyes and also for the lovers of the Forts history right back even further than the Portuguese. One of the suites was apparently the living area of the 14th Century Commander Chin Ho reminding us that the Chinese were here a full century before the Portuguese. The original foundation of this mansion is over 400 years old and was probably used by the Portuguese and Dutch as a trading office. The present hotel is a reflection of the grandeur of 400 years with the restoration completed by two enterprising foreign gentlemen who were experts at restoration. It was sold to a local family about 4 years ago and continues to be an attraction of old world charm and superior hospitality.\nThe hotel has 12 suites and averages almost full occupancy throughout the year at an average USD 250++. 50% of reservations are direct and the rest walk-ins and web based. General Manager David Elgar says he is very happy with his staff and is very content to be here. To understand the Galle Fort Hotel is to understand its history and the valuable contribution it is making towards tourism in Sri Lanka.\nThe Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 423 years has stood the test of time, due to extensive reconstruction work done by Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka. In 1988, UNESCO listed Galle Fort as a World Heritage Site. Prior to the departure of the most recent British administration the majority of properties in Galle were handed over to a predominantly Galle Muslim community. In those days other wealthy families would have used the GFT as weekend retreat.\nMr Azhar is the owner of a gem, jewellery, miners and exporters business, is located 3 shops down from the Galle Fort Hotel. He has been in the business for 50 years and his family are 3rd generation resident’s of Galle. His Uncle Mr Muhiden was the previous owner of GFH and conducted his gem distribution business from the hotel.\nIn 1999 the Sri Lankan government lifted the 100% tax on foreign ownership, which resulted in Australian, Karl Steinberg, and his Malaysian partner Christopher Ong purchasing the dilapidated and abandoned 17th century Dutch merchant’s house. Spending two years renovating the house using local craftsmen and traditional building techniques and by 2004 the Galle Fort Hotel opened.\nThe Galle Fort Hotel has won a number of awards including the 2007 UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Award of Distinction, for heritage conservation. It was the 2010 winner of ‘Sri Lanka’s Leading Boutique Hotel’ at the World Travel Awards. The hotel was again nominating in the 2015 World Travel Awards as Sri Lanka’s leading boutique hotel. In 2011 Colombo Fort Hotels an associate company of Lankem Ceylon PLC purchased the hotel.\nThe hotel offers and contributes to a truly historical cultural boutique experience. Its 12 individually designed suites open out to the centrally located inner courtyard and the 10m swimming pools offer’s a tranquil exclusive area for guests. The rooms are luxuriously and individually furnished with king-sized beds dressed with canopied mosquito netting, crisp white linen and comfortable pillows.\nThe ‘Admiral Cheng Ho suite’ is a large two-storey suite that commemorates the visit of Admiral Cheng Ho to Galle in 1406.  The upper floor bedroom has a carved Chinese opium bed and work desk. A screen made from rare antique columns provides privacy from the living area below furnished with intricate pieces of oriental furniture and a day bed. The attached open-air bathroom has six-metre columns with a large elevated outdoor ‘waterfall’ shower.\nThe Grand Apartment is a grand suite and its 2,500 square feet occupies the entire top floor of the old wing. The room is divided into two king-sized bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms and a private verandah. The apartment features original 17th century artworks, antique chests and cabinets, an eight seater antique dining table and two large Dutch period four-poster beds.\nThe bar-cum-cafe is a great meeting point and has huge potential to attract greater market share. David the General manager plans to make it the hot spot of the area by making it more open and friendly to outsiders and passers by.\nOpen to non-guests the restaurant is very much in tune with the Fort prices and receives much positive feedback for its Sri Lankan style and western dishes and promotes freshly and locally bought produce.\nDavid Elgar the General Manager has worked across multiple hospitality business sectors including hotel management, resort project management, high end luxury resorts, medi-spa health and wellness retreats, with over 30 years hands on hospitality experience. He has international experience working in ‘developing countries’ such as Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Fiji, Seychelles and now Sri Lanka.\nHe believes there is an art to managing people. The leadership style he adopts emphasizes and recognizes the importance of engaging with individuals in an approachable, constructive manner in order to achieve business success. As a Manager, he applies critical attention to the continued alignment of training staff, spelling out their expected roles and matching it by performance.\n“I believe that while I am working and living in Sri Lanka I will not only be able to make a contribution to tourism in the country but also pass on my knowledge and skills to the staff at the Galle Fort Hotel and make them feel proud about who they are. Encouraging self-confidence and empowering people to think on their feet will improve self-worth and a hotel that promotes good energy is a hotel that will travel to great heights. This is my aim.”\nThe landscape of Galle Fort continually changes. Today a Museum occupies the stables; jewelry shops abound; cafes emerge from behind restored columns; interior design shops mingle with bookstores and fashion outlets and the supply of new hotels continue to grow. The number of hostels, hotels, boutiques, restaurants and shops are are too numerous to mention so we instead invite you to visit the Galle Fort and walk these beautiful old colonial cobbled streets and discover the treasures of the Fort for your self.\nJungle beach\nNot far from the Fort is my favorite hideaway beach. The Jungle beach. Drive outside the Dutch Fort turn right stop at the road side wine store on the left for a bottle of red or white and keep going past the highway intersection and just before Unawatuna, turn to your right and up the hill. A minute’s drive and on top of the hill there is cosy stop where you climb down and meander between trees and rocks until you reach the beach. It’s devastatingly beautiful and mostly private with only a few tourists or locals about. The beach and water are all yours. Right across the sea you can see the Galle fort in the distance and on the left another iconic and historic hotel the Closenburg, the rich history of which we will research in detail for the column another week.\nThe local entrepreneurial spirit is alive here on jungle beach with a family of fisherman doing a roaring business in iced soft drinks and eats that include freshly caught prawns, lobsters and coral fish to go with the wine you picked up at the shop. Tables are set and the service is jungle but politely flawless and perfect for the mise en scene. A table beach picnic with the fresh catch of the day of your choice prepared on the spot. Another reason to fall in love (with Galle) all over again. Sip your wine, bath in the sea and watch the sun set on far away Galle fort and realize not for the first time that you are in the most beautiful country in the world.",

Earlier members of the human genus, Homo, date back more than 2 million years. Our genus was predated by other species on the human family tree including various representatives of the genus Australopithecus.\nMembers of Lucy’s species were contemporaries of Little Foot, although Lucy herself lived about 500,000 years later.\nLike Lucy, Little Foot was female. The species was much bigger and taller than Lucy’s, with gorilla-like facial features but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for climbing, according to paleoanthropologists Ron Clarke and Kathy Kuman of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\n\n \n \nSource: TheTelegraph",

Alonso said that it was a normal concussion and the unconsciousness was due to medication and said it didn’t last for more than two hours. He also said that he was able to turn off the radio and the car’s master switch before the marshals arrived at the location.\nWhen asked about McLaren’s initial report which said that wind blew the car off course, Alonso replied saying that not even a hurricane could move the car at that speed. Alonso went on to say that he trusts the team and every component of the car has been checked and every doubtful part has been replaced. He stated that both him and the team should be fine as the season progress.\nFernando Alonso has won the Formula 1 World Drivers Championship twice and is considered as the best driver on the current formula one grid.",

        "content": "Brown University researchers combined images from NASA’s CTX instrument with mineralogical data from NASA’s CRISM orbiting spectrometer to create a geologic history of flowing water on the surface of Mars nearly 4 billion years ago.\nThey completed a new analysis of an ancient Martian lake system in Jezero Crater , near the planet’s equator.\nThe study found that the onslaught of water that filled the crater was one of at least two separate periods of water activity in the region surrounding Jezero.\nThe ancient lake at Jezero crater was first identified in 2005 by Caleb Fassett, a former Brown graduate student now a professor at Mount Holyoke College.\nFassett identified two channels on the northern and western sides of the crater that appear to have supplied it with water.\nThat water eventually overtopped the crater wall on the southern side and flowed out through a third large channel.\nIt’s not clear how long the system was active, but seems to have dried out around 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.\nThe map showed that each of the fan deposits has its own distinct mineral signature that matches the signature of the watershed from which it was sourced.\nThe minerals’ formation and their transportation seem to have been separated by a fair amount of time.\nMapping of the watershed showed a younger layer of rock that sits on top of the hydrated minerals.\nThe crater’s inlet channels cut through that layer of younger rock. That meant the water that carved the channels must have flowed well after the mineral layer had formed.\nThat finding could shed light on the water story for early Mars. It’s clear that Mars was once much wetter than it is now, but it’s not clear that the Martian climate was warm enough to sustain liquid water at the surface for long periods.\nSome researchers have suggested that if the early Martian climate was cold, chemical alteration on Mars may have been driven largely by water percolating in the warmer subsurface crust. That period of subsurface activity was followed some time later by pulses of water on the surface, potentially sourced by either snowmelt or rainfall, during transient periods of warm temperatures.\nThat second round of events was largely responsible for the mechanical erosion on the Martian surface.\nThe study is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.",

The removal of a judge should be confined to Article 78 Sub Article 7 of the Standing Orders. But unfortunately there was no mention of the 78/7 in the motion. Now having done so they realised that, to say the least, they made a mistake, a terrible mistake. I wont say its a complicated constitutional process, but I must say the words as referred to in the laws, the Standing Orders and the Constitution should be followed to the letter. You are removing the Chief Justice of a country. So what was conveyed by the Speaker to the President is important, because this has not been in the public domain. There’s not a word in this communication addressed to the President to remove the judge. In these circumstances she has not been removed. That’s the position that the BAR took, that’s the position that we have finally indicated.\nAttorney-at-Law Gomin Dayasiri expressed these views:\nI think its quite fashionable these days for chief justices to be booted. Because every chief justice nowadays seems to be getting booted. Maybe I am the only unique person in that sense, I supported the removal of Shirani Bandaranaike and opposed the appointment of Mohan Peiris. Mohan Peiris was a Legal Adviser to the government, was attached to the Defense Ministry. How can you possibly accept justice in such a case? You make political appointments, whether it is Shirani Bandaranayake from Chandrika Bandaranaike’s regime or Mohan Peiris from the Rajapaksa regime, it is wrong.\nAttorney-at-Law Saliya Pieris shared these views:\nIn the eyes of the law Mr. Mohan Peiris was never Chief Justice of this country. So if he was not Chief Justice of this country, there is no need for him to be impeached. Because to try to have him impeached would be to recognise that he was Chief Justice. And that would be doing injustice to the constitution. Even to move to impeach him would be to recognize that he is valid. He is the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. So in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of the constitution, his appointment was an absolute nullity.",

Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are set to get into a legal battle with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) regarding the participation of their star spinner Sunil Narine, according to a report.\nWest Indian Narine was banned for his suspect action during the 2014 Champions League Twenty20 and was barred from playing in the final against Chennai Super Kings. KKR lost the game by eight wickets. Following that, Narine was dropped from West Indies’ tour of India in November and then, the mystery spinner himself opted out of the 2015 World Cup.\nNarine went back to the nets to rework on his action and was cleared by the ICC after his bio-mechanical test in Loughborough.\nHowever, BCCI refused to accept the ICC report and has insisted that the off-spinner from Trinidad has to undergo another round of testing at the Sri Ramachandra University in Chennai.\nKKR, as expected, is now contemplating legal action against BCCI, according to a report in the Mumbai Mirror. The Kolkata franchise officials have pointed out that since Narine was cleared by the ICC, he shouldn’t be forced to undergo another one. The team has also alleged the BCCI of ‘targeting’ their star spinner.\nKKR also said that Narine was not hauled up for ‘chucking’ during the IPL but his action was suddenly found illegal in the CLT20.\nThe BCCI president’s office has confirmed that a decision would be taken regarding this matter in the next few days. KKR chief executive officer Venky Mysore, however, has denied the reports about KKR speaking to the BCCI chief.\nSource: NDTV",

The Police noted that rather than strictly enforcing the law from the outset, they would implement the rule in stages.\nAccordingly, while motorcyclists were stopped and advised, no fine or punishment was imposed.\n Police claim that the ban was enforced, due to the spreading virus of theft carried out by thieves wearing full face helmets and the rise in accidents due to reduced visibility.\nNational Committee Member of Voice of the Youth, Asitha Niroshan expressed these views: \nProfessor Dickman Otte of Hanoi University in Germany conducted a study in 2010 along with other experts. The full-face helmet was designed on a scientific basis. They have marked the damage that occurs when motorcyclists meet with accidents. 19.7 percent of the damage is on the base of the neck. Almost 35 percent is to the face.

        "content": "Connventional IT wisdom says that you’re safer and more secure when you control your own on-premises data center. Yet if you think about every major data breach over the last two years, whether Anthem, Sony, JPMorgan or Target, all involved on-premises data centers, not the cloud.\nIn fact, if a cloud service has proper controls, it could be safer than running your own data center. Amazon, Google, Sales force and Box to a company have much more at stake when it comes to security. A breach could prove devastating to their businesses.\nThat could be why it’s hard to come up with a major security involving a cloud provider. Other than the Jennifer Lawrence photo breach and the subsequent celebrity leaks, it’s hard to think of anything on the magnitude of those high-profile hacks involving the cloud. It could simply come down to a feeling of control. When you run your data center on-premises, you feel like you’re safer, but are you?\nFirst of all, aside from a few exceptions, most companies simply don’t put the resources into security that a cloud company does.\nTheir business is not about security, at least not directly, and it’s usually not the first priority for a CEO looking at the bottom line. While a high profile hack is embarrassing and creates a lot of economic fall-out, the primary purpose of the business is about servicing customers.\nSource: Mashable",

The majority trial at bar judgment had ignored this important fact.\r\n \r\nPresident council said it is surprising to note that the majority judgment by Honorable Padmini Ranawaka stated that a case has been filed against Gamini for causing grievous hurt to Former MP Duminda Silva when there is no such case filed at all.\r\n \r\nHe questioned how the honorable judge arrive at such a conclusion, as nothing of this sort was revealed in evidence.\r\n \r\nThe President Counsel further pointed out that the Baratha Lakshman’s faction started the shooting as Duminda Silva was turning to leave the scene.\r\n \r\nHe said that every incident erupted because Baratha Lakshman’s bodyguard, Gamini started the shooting.\r\n \r\nThe President Counsel further stated that both factions would have dispersed if Baratha Lakshman's faction hadn’t fired gunshots injuring Duminda Silva.\r\n \r\nHe emphasized that when Duminda Silva Arrived at the scene no one including Duminda Silva would have ever imagined that Gamini will fire at Duminda Silva and as such the origin of the incident was sudden.\r\n \r\nUnder these circumstances, any charges if at all should be directed as personal and individual.\r\n \r\nFurther, it was pointed out that the prosecution had failed to prove who had shot at Baratha faction when they were running away after shooting Duminda Silva.\r\n \r\nMeanwhile, President Counsel, Anura Meddegoda stated that the investigators have fabricated a story on the recovery of firearms with an intention to falsely implicate Duminda Silva.\r\n \r\nHe pointed out that the accused from whom recovery of such firearms was made had been wrongly arrested at the Airport and, the investigators had forced him to place his signature on blank papers.\r\n \r\nThe President Counsel pointed out that it is questionable how charges against Duminda Silva for using firearms had been filed.\r\n \r\nIn addition, President Counsel Saliya Peries stated that he too agreed with the submissions made previously by his two fellow President Counsels.\r\n \r\nThe oral submissions were concluded today and, Chief Justice Priyasath Dep stated that the written submissions should be filed before August 10th.\r\n \r\nThe bench of five Supreme Court Judges led by Chief Justice, Priyasath Dep advised the Attorney general and the defense counsels to address the written submissions to include matters relating to:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nFactual and legal discrepancies and misdirections in the judgment of the high court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDraw the attention of court on the omissions and contradictions in evidence that has not been considered by the high court \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the high court order is in accordance with the requirements of the law \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress court on legal implications of the unlawful assembly \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegality of the evidence placed regarding a purported recovery of firearms \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShooting incident at Himbutana",

        "content": "Presidents Counsel Anil Silva impressed upon the court that if Bharatha Lakshman’s bodyguard had not fired the first shot at Duminda Silva’s head causing grievous hurt, all other resultant and subsequent events would not have happened.\r\n \r\nThe appeal by former MP Duminda Silva seeking the Supreme Court to acquit him was again taken up by the five bench Supreme Court judges chaired by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep.\r\n \r\nPresidents Counsel  Anil Silva responding in reply to Attorney General Department’s verbal submission earlier summarized several facts and placed before the court, points on which all parties including the attorney general’s department agreed upon, which includes;\r\n \r\n \r\n * No firearm handled by Duminda Silva at any time during the day under review\r\n * Former MP Duminda Silva did NOT fire a single shot at any given time\r\n * The meeting of the two parties was accidental\r\n * The First shot was fired at Duminda Silva causing grievous hurt to his head, who fell unconscious to the ground instantly\r\n * Duminda Silva was immediately evacuated from the scene of the incident and rushed to the Hospital\r\n \r\n \r\nIn addition, the President’s Counsel reiterated that Bharatha Premachandra’s bodyguard “Gamini” fired the first shot injuring Duminda Silva, as emphasized by the attorney generals Department, which in fact precipitated and ignited all subsequent events.\r\n \r\nHe also said that Duminda Silva who received grievous penetrating gunshot injuries to his head, fell unconscious and was immediately removed to the hospital, and as such cannot be held responsible for any events that took place thereafter.\r\n \r\nHe posed the question, how under these circumstances Duminda Silva, who was unconscious and evacuated immediately from the scene, could be made guilty of a Murder Charge.\r\n \r\nHe emphasized that the evidence given by a single witness “interested” due to his close association with Bharatha Lakshman whose statements to the CID was belated, could be considered while disregarding all other versions of all other prosecution witnesses especially those made by trained government security officers.\r\n \r\nFurther, the President’s Counsel stated that the narration of this single interested witness cannot be reconciled, when considering forensic evidence of experts and judicial medical officers.\r\n \r\nHe echoed that irrespective of all these important facts which were analytically placed before the Trial at Bar, none of these had been considered at the time of delivering the majority trial at bar verdict, probably as they were clouded by the desire to convict the 11th accused.\r\n \r\nThe Counsel pointed out that Duminda Silva was deprived of a fair trial even though the judgement itself says that none of the witnesses can be relied upon 100%.\r\n \r\n \r\nExtracting points from the High Court Judgement itself, Anil Silva placed before the Supreme Court instances where the investigators have threatened and intimidated witnesses to fall in line with the false evidences fabricated by them and making those who did not compromise listed as accused.\r\n \r\nHere again, all instances of falsification had been placed before the Trial at Bar judges, but completely ignored in arriving at the majority judgement.\r\n \r\n \r\nPresidents Counsel   Anil Silva pointed out that the Attorney Generals department had admitted in their written submissions to the trial at bar “If only the Himbutana shooting incident occurred the accused could not have been charged in the manner they have now being charged”.\r\n \r\nPresidents Counsel concluded saying under these circumstances the investigators worked backwards and fabricated events to implicate and charge Former MP Duminda Silva.\r\n \r\nFurther, Presidents Counsel  Anil Silva pointed out that the verdict delivered finding Duminda Silva guilty was presented by one learned judge and since the other supporting learned Judge had not given his reasoning, the judgement by its self does not stand acceptable in its true sense.\r\n \r\nThe 3rd Learned Judge who had delivered the dissenting judgement at the trial at bar had acquitted all accused including Duminda Silva from all charges.
